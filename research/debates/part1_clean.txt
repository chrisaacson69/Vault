Okay. So, when we're talking about the issue of secularism,

>> yeah,

>> or not secularism, I'm sorry, liberalism.

>> Wait, liberalism is what we're discussing here.

>> So, we'll pull back up on the notes since we went down that whole train of nonsense.

>> It's not nonsense. It's like foundational philosophy. Phil 101. Really, it's kind of important. You like to weaponize it for your dumb audience against mean people to like innocent only fans girls to be like see their belief system isn't justified and it's like no one's name a single time when I've done that. uh every time you were on the show.

>> Yeah. So, give me you got do you have one?

>> Uh yeah. When you debate any secular person, when you debated Charlie, when you debate Destiny, when you debated Nimmo, when you debated Zeno, when you debated like eternally your belief system is unjustifiable, that's a that's a dire thing. Your your belief I do the opposite. I start at the end. I just say if it's the case that it's just preferences, then you have absolutely no criticism for me imposing mine. Uh well most most secular people if they're good on philosophy would say well it's not just preferences right it's it's some mixture of like we use if they're utilitarian they would use utiles preferences

>> not really these are like there's no more preferences than you preferring God

>> that's my point

>> but then all of this is empty

>> that's right

>> so your arguments wait but then you have to grant that your arguments are just as empty as theirs

>> if that's the case then you would have no room to criticize me for imposing my preferences

>> we could because then we could just use reason and logic and evidence of what seems to benefit people.

>> Your preference is just my preference. I

>> think I think it's reasonable to assume that I prefer that what like people are well that people experience less harm, right? And I think that's a reasonable preference to have cuz I want it.

>> Then it's perfectly reasonable for me to say no.

>> I didn't say it's unreasonable.

>> Then there's nothing to argue there

>> because you're insisting that they're unjustifiable while you are. And I'm saying no, you're all unjustifiable, but both are actually reasonable. You can have your Christian preferences, but as a Christian, I'm fighting you and saying, "Actually, your preferences are icky and bad for the faith. Don't do it." Also, Jesus wasn't political, so you're kind of going against what Jesus taught. Also bad to do.

>> Okay. So, then back to this when we're talking about liberalism and the system of liberalism and you're appealing to consensus, right? If the consensus is that they want to kill every third baby, which is just part of their like preferences, man, and they assume that it's fine, you don't you can't actually critique that thing.

>> Of course you can. We do it all the time

>> with what?

>> Um, you could use util utilitarianism and you could say actually killing babies is bad because it makes a worse world. It harms that specific baby. It probably also harms the mother, which would actually decrease the amount of flourishing and increase the amount of harm, which is why I think it would be bad to do. That's what a utilitarian could say

>> and then say but you would say that that

>> God doesn't like it when you kill babies unless he orders you to do it like in the

>> Malachites. And which one of you is right?

>> Well, we would have to fight. I mean, the issue is like we have to assume at the end of

>> fight, right?

>> Yeah. And I would go, I think my argument is more reasonable. I wouldn't say my argument is more justifiable at a foundational level. This is what you do. You try to say my beliefs are foundationally justified and yours are not, which is why I'm reasonable and you're not. It's like that's not true.

>> Actually, I do the opposite. I start at the end of the argument and say I agree with you. It's all

>> just because you the like chronology of how you get there is different. It doesn't change that this is the tactic that you typically utilize when you debate people.

>> Listen, I'm doing the same thing with you. We're at the end now.

>> Yeah. You're like I start at the end and I walk people all the way back to originals.

>> I'm just asking you

>> and then I go see how silly this is. I'm not silly. And I'm saying you're just as unjustified as a single question here which is that reason consensus when you're talking about consensus that that's how you want things to be, right? Well, no. This is not an ought. Like, a consensus isn't an ought. I think it's the best system that's arrived so far.

>> So, when I asked you a better one,

>> when I asked you earlier, this is an ought and you said yes. That's not the case.

>> Uh, well, there's a second part to what I was saying, I believe, at the time.

>> No, I asked you is consensus how we ought do, how Christians ought to do things. You said yes.

>> No, I didn't.

>> Yes, you did.

>> No,

>> I specifically wrote it [laughter] down.

>> If I did, I didn't mean it.

>> You didn't?

>> No, I should have clarified. What do you actually want to ask here?

>> Yeah. So I want to just ask you about consensus. So if if they want to kill every third baby

>> Mhm.

>> Okay.

>> I would oppose this.

>> Yeah. But why would they be actually wrong?

>> Uh I would for example I would in the case of a pagan I would probably appeal to their own moral system. I think that most people for example I believe you probably believe this too that God gives us conscious right he like puts a spirit inside of us that um God's uh metaethical system emerges naturally out of us right? So like what I would do for example is I would probably first of all try to examine that pagan's belief system and I would be like do you actually think killing babies is okay right I would I would I would actually morally question them and one of the issues is that this is unobservable we can't truly know whether somebody thinks something is wrong or right but I think the knowledge of wrong or right is really important kind of biblical one might even say so I would question whether or not they know it's wrong or right and then I would appeal to things like state so like civic ei civic ethics for example it doesn't work very well in nations to kill every third baby. You're just reducing your population. Usually the mothers don't like it. Usually the fathers don't like it. Doesn't seem to have any good outcome. In fact, most the reasons why people in the past killed babies was to satisfy some sun god. And we would go that's not an overly reasonable argument. It's probably more reasonable to say we shouldn't kill babies. That seems more reasonable. So I could appeal to them within their own worldview of secularism or their own worldview of paganism.

>> Sure. And they say, "Fuck you. We don't care."

>> Are they in my state?

>> Uh, no. No,

>> they're in another country.

>> Yeah. I'm just asking why they're [clears throat] wrong. Why they're doing something wrong?

>> Why they're doing something wrong?

>> Why is that wrong? Yeah.

>> Because I think it's immoral to kill babies.

>> Why?

>> Because I think God doesn't like you to kill babies unless he orders it. Like in the Malikite.

>> Because he assumed you assumed that.

>> I assumed God. Yep.

>> You assumed it. And so they assume

>> Well, I'm assuming God. Yeah.

>> So they assume not God.

>> Yep.

>> And so they come to you and say, "Well, you're just assuming this anyway."

>> And I would say, "So are you."

>> And then they would say, "Good. We're going to go back to killing babies." And the problem with that is why? say, "I'm going to use my language and quill to convince you that you're wrong and that there's a more compelling and better way to live, and I'm going to appeal to the spirit that I think God puts into all of us to try to pull out of you the fact that murder is actually really bad."

>> I see. So, if a Christian nationalist does that within a liberal system, they're not doing anything wrong.

>> Um, yeah. So, you guys can try to compel people to Christianity, but my issue isn't

>> No, we can compel you to We can compel ourselves to the will of the state. Why not? What's wrong with that?

>> I mean, I don't know what you're saying right now. If if Christians take over the entire state, rewrite the entirety of the Constitution within your liberal framework,

>> they can in the liberal framework, but as a Christian, I think that they're being uncchristian by doing

>> Yeah, but who cares? You're just assuming it.

>> Um God cares, and I'm assuming that we're all Christian.

>> Yeah, but I assume God doesn't care.

>> Uh I I would question your Christian theology.

>> Oh, why? I just assumed it.

>> Scripture. Do you think that like logic, reason, evidence, scripture doesn't exist outside of like foundations?

>> It doesn't matter. What matters is what I assume. How would scripture [clears throat] not matter when I'm talking to fellow

>> because I just assume things?

>> Well, no, you don't just assume things. You're you're equivocating again. So, what you're doing? Because you're saying assuming at a foundational. So, when I say assume, I mean at a foundational axiomatic level. That is not the same thing.

>> My axiom is that I'm always right

>> about everything. Why can't it be an axiom?

>> Because it's not talogical.

>> I'm right because I'm right. That's a tautology.

>> Yeah. Now you're now I can go I don't think that's justified and then I would prove you wrong.

>> Okay, but who cares? You you just said nothing's justified.

>> Sorry. Are we just doing like nihilism warp tour? Nobody should care. Nobody should care about you granted me that even at Christianity you granted me that your worldview is just as un uh like unimportant. So how do you make people care?

>> Because that makes my point actually your hands off. You're like ah none of it matters. My system is just as if it is the case. Now I at least understand what you're saying. So great. If it's the case

>> took uh 2 hours and 15 minutes.

>> Yeah. If it's the case that we're just assuming the worldview at a foundational level and it's an axiom I'm right cuz I'm right now we have a tautology. Then there's actually no good reason for me not to assume that I'm just right about reforming liberalism after my own image.

>> So reason can be includes things like inductive and deductive logic. This is the stuff that we build off of our axioms, right? can

>> well that's what we do that's what all philosophical systems are that's what you do that's what I do

>> well that's an assumption [laughter] [gasps]

>> this is crazy

>> because foundationally you're assuming it right

>> oh yeah you're right Andrew everything doesn't matter anything at all and in fact everything that you say doesn't matter and none of your systems are justified and it's all just arbitrary and silly

>> so then that's what you're saying too

>> if by your view yeah

>> no no you granted my view you said I'll grant you a purpose how

>> yeah that this is our view now baby you said you're joining me. You're in the agrius dilemma acceptance state. Okay.

>> In fact, then if that's the case,

>> you're just as arbitrary and just as stupid and we can't assume anything.

>> So So if that's the case,

>> we shouldn't talk about anything. Why are we here? Let each other finish, please.

>> So I just want to know.

>> Well, you're in my world. How are you solving that now?

>> What would the argument What What now is the argument for me to impose Christian nationalism?

>> Let me ask that to you. What's your argument for it?

>> Cuz I want to.

>> You're just assuming that. Cuz I want to. Yeah. But that you're just assuming

>> that it's a tautology. So I'm supposed to That doesn't make it right.

>> Exactly. So it's fine to do. So, why are you saying that it's an ought statement?

>> Wait a second. I'm assuming, right?

>> Yeah. So, why is it an ought statement?

>> Because I want it to be. Cuz I assume it.

>> Okay. So, your your system is wholly unjustifiable. There's no reason why Christians should do it. They're just like moving on violence.

>> And there's no reason for Christians not to do it.

>> Okay.

>> Right.

>> Uh I So I believe in a I'm a foundationalist. So I believe in

>> Yeah. But you assume your foundations can't be justified.

>> Everyone assumes foundations. You've already granted me this. Then if that's the case then who cares what your foundation is

>> because in philosophy we typically ground foundations to some extent.

>> We don't do anything in philosophy. I don't know what you do with philosophy but

>> okay Mr. Philosopher in in uh any level of respected philosophy we assume

>> which respected philosophers are you are you uh are you referencing

>> Plato Socrates uh what are some modern ones that I can think of?

>> What did Socrates Socrates assumed that you couldn't justify anything? Well, no. What he Well, sort of. What we do is we grant assumptions because we understand that at a foundational level, they're all unjustified.

>> All you did was destroy the possibility for there to be objective morality. That's it.

>> Nope. Because I think God exists.

>> Yeah. But you just assume it.

>> So, but non-Christians also assume that he doesn't exist.

>> Yeah. So, then if they have an anti-moral realist position, you

>> I would use logic and reason to compel them as to why I'm correct.

>> Okay. Let's assume for a second I'm a moral anti-realist. Mhm.

>> Use logic and and reason to compel me when you tell me that your whole worldview is just assumed.

>> Sorry, [laughter] you really love that assumed word. Can you rephrase that in a way that's coherent?

>> That was coherent, but I'll do it again.

>> Let's assume it wasn't

>> foundationally.

>> Let's assume.

>> I'm a moral anti-realist. Okay.

>> Your moral foundations are assumed.

>> Mhm.

>> And not justified.

>> And I would say, how do you solve a Grippa tile?

>> No, no, no. You told me the moral anti-realist that.

>> Yeah. And then the anti-realist goes, "Well, your opinions are just assumed, right?" And I go, "Yeah, how do you solve a group of

>> Why would they need to? They're anti-realists."

>> So even even

>> you just destroyed the possibility for objective morality, everybody.

>> No, I didn't. No, even subjectivists fail a Griffith's trilmma. They fail by infinite regression.

>> Okay. Again, [laughter] who cares?

>> You forgot about that one, didn't you?

>> That doesn't hurt my argument.

>> Yes, it does. I if I'm an anti-realist, a moral anti-realist, I say there are no moral facts and I that is completely and totally in line with a grippa trilmma.

>> Uh so a grippa trima would say how do you solve for infinite regression?

>> Why would I need to?

>> Because it's a fallacy. [laughter]

>> So thinking is a fallacy.

>> No, infinite regression is a fallacy.

>> Okay, but everything's going to reduce to infinite to an infinite regress, right?

>> So what's comes before thinking?

>> Well, that's that would be transcendentals would come before thinking.

>> Okay. And what comes before that?

>> Well, we would make the justification of God, right?

>> So, you're assuming. So, no secular anti-realists assume God.

>> You?

>> No, not me.

>> You don't assume God.

>> I do assume God. We were talking about moralist. Andrew, respectfully, we should probably I don't think you're ready for this conversation. I don't think

>> No, I'm having a good time with this one.

>> I just want to make sure that me, the moral anti-realist,

>> right, that you are telling me that objective morality is real, right? And I would use reason and logic and argumentation and I would build off of my foundational axioms that a good faith moral anti-realist would just grant me. So they'd be like, "Well, why do you believe God?" And I'm like, "I just assume him." And they're like, "Okay, well, I can't really contend with that. It's just assumed." And then I build my entire case for why I think morals are objective because I think God instilled them outside of us and that they are in every person. And I say, "You can see this in the universal ways in which morals consistently emerge. We see this trajectory of humankind moving towards greater and greater moral systems, right? free speech and respecting one another and treating every other one kindly. And what you'll notice most importantly is not only are those morals objective, but they're the Christian ones because God is real. My God specifically is real. That's how I would do that argumentation.

>> Okay. So, are there moral facts?

>> Yeah. Yes.

>> That and are they just assumed?

>> Uh, yeah. At a foundational level.

>> Okay. So, then any moral facts that I assume at a foundational level are equivalent to any moral facts you assume at a foundational level?

>> No, not equivalent. I didn't say these are all equivocal.

>> What would make them different?

>> My my use of inductive and deductive logic is better. I use better reason. I have more evidence for my

>> better. Hang on. What does better mean here?

>> Better means like more coherent, more consistent. Like

>> why is that better?

>> Uh because it seems to produce uh better thinking. It seems to uh that's a tautology. [snorts]

>> Yes.

>> It's better because it's better.

>> Yeah. Tautologies. Welcome to Welcome to Phil.

>> Yeah. So So then I just want to make sure. So, so you're just going to endlessly be in a case of infinite regress and tutology.

>> Sweet of you. I appreciate that.

>> And then and then there's no moral facts or just assume.

>> Just let me pour my energy drink at Brian respectfully. And then we'll get back into you really struggling with philosophy.

>> Oh, I'm having I'm having a struggle. That's true.

>> You are.

>> It's very This has been very difficult for me. I agree. I mean, hey, you've at least accepted my the reality that your beliefs are just as unjustified as everyone else that you mock, which is great.

>> So, might makes right.

>> No.

>> Yeah, it does. [laughter]

>> Yes, it Why wouldn't it?

>> Uh because of things like coercive power versus legitimate authority.

>> Who cares about that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're just assuming it.

>> No. So, again,

>> at its foundation, whatever arguments you have,

>> all of this around me just doesn't exist because I'm assuming it.

>> Wait, wait, wait. material things.

>> Yeah.

>> Is philosophy material?

>> Yeah, it can be.

>> How

>> pragmatism is often

>> how

>> pragmatism? Yeah, it's often interested in like material effects.

>> That's not material.

>> That's you're just saying what it's

>> I am so sorry. Hold on.

>> Party foul. Uh

>> you were so sweet to remind me and then I destroyed your tech.

>> Did we get all the tech out of the way?

>> Uh can we get paper towels? Yeah, just uh pass them to Kyla there. Little [snorts] spillage. It's okay here. No, no, no. It's all good. We I'll I'll take care of it. You guys continue with the debate. It's all good. Don't worry about it. I'll No, it's all good.

>> Let's get on your stream deck first, though, so it doesn't get any worse.

>> Yeah. Yeah. Here, let me take care of it, though. You guys can continue on with the conversation. It's all good. It's all good.

>> I'm so sorry about

>> It's okay. I'll continue.

>> So,

>> when I knocked that over, did that happen materially or did we just all assume that it happened?

>> Well, I would say that that happened in material reality.

>> Oh, and so how do we think about that? like how do we decide that actually it fell because of gravity versus like God trying to push it down?

>> Uh we would probably run an experiment or something like that.

>> Yeah, we would use like reason and logic to build up a belief system.

>> Well, the thing is though is like

>> that wouldn't make philosophy material.

>> So not all of philos so philosophy like the uh art of loving wisdom isn't material but it commentates on material as well.

>> Yeah, but you just said it was material.

>> Well, part of it can be material. Yeah.

>> Which parts? the the part that is your brain thinking about things.

>> Is your brain not material?

>> Okay. So, is the philosophy itself material

>> or is the brain material?

>> The brain's material.

>> Okay. So, then not the philosophy again.

>> I don't know why you think that this is a dunk. Um saying I said philosophy can engage in the material. Of course.

>> But you you said

>> and then I said for example, one of the schools is pragmatism.

>> Yeah. But that's not material.

>> Sure. Okay.

>> Okay. [snorts]

>> You win. You're so smart, Andrew. You got me. I don't know. Hey, you're way better at this than me. Help me out, though. Um, I'm actually fine. Uh, kind of staying right here.

>> So, you accept that your belief system is just as unjustifiable.

>> Oh, sure. Especially for the purpose of this conversation.

>> No, no, no. Not for the purpose of this conversation. Don't be like bad faith and presume. It is bad faith to presume things that you don't actually believe. Don't do not do not purport to me that you believe in things that you don't believe. is definitionally bad faith

>> uh by self-d delusion or selfdeception or in this case explicit deception saying yeah I believe this and it's like no you don't you literally don't

>> got it

>> or do you

>> do I what

>> do you believe that agrip's trilmma means that all

>> one you convinced me

>> okay so now I I'm not I don't know what to do with this I guess falling into snark is your way of solving your bad philosing snark

>> because you are either being genuine

>> you convinced me

>> and rude

>> you convinced me all moral moral foundations are completely unjustified. And since all moral foundations are completely unjustified, any facts we build off of those are not going to be justified.

>> Uh well, they're not going to be exematically justified, but they can be reasonable and coherent.

>> So it's still they're still unjustified.

>> Yeah, but we seem to like value these things. It seems to produce good outcomes.

>> But you could never say we seem we seem we seem it seems to me like I that men could collectivize and just beat the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of women, stuff them in cages, too. That seems to me like a possibility. Sure. The issue is

>> the there's no other men wouldn't like that. Men are a class.

>> A lot of men would love it. They did it for years. Half the world enslaves half the women. What do you mean?

>> Okay. Men also freed a lot of women, right?

>> And they also enslave them. Okay.
