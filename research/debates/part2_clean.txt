No, because liberalism is opposed to no liberal liberalism liberalism iso opposed to uh tyranny.

>> Okay. inherently

>> first of all

>> particularly of monarchy

>> your liberal framework has amendments in it and these amendments can be at any time changed by liberal framework the constitution or is it a framework of of no it's political philosophy the constitution isn't my political philosophy

>> yeah if we're talking what would we be using if

>> and I want to make sure that your political philosophy isn't kind of important when we're talking about liberalism

>> but I thought your political philosophy was just life liberty pursuit of happiness No.

>> Oh,

>> that was something I pointed to as like a essential American ethos.

>> So, what is the liberal foundational philosophy then?

>> Uh, typically it's going to be uh maximizing like freedoms and and and rights of people. So, giving people both uh rights um and what's the other one when it's not rights, it's like privileges. I forget the word. I'm I'm blanking right now. Uh it gives them access to rights. It has strong institutions. And in more modern forms of liberalism, which I like by the way, it believes in a uh social safety net. Entitle. Entitlements.

>> Entitlements.

>> No, there's like a fill there's a political fill word where it's like you have both rights and oh, I don't know why I can't think of this word right now. My brain is like uh you could probably look it up. Right. Liberties. Rights and liberties.

>> Okay. And

>> liberties are the things that you get that aren't your right.

>> The problem you have here is that your foundation here is is democracy, right?

>> Uh well, a liberal system, I think, works best with a democracy. I think liberal democracy

>> so within the confines of a democracy as long as people vote out the liberal system the liberal system literally lets them do that right

>> yeah I agree but this is why I think that the founding fathers did a really good job of setting up like girding principles against this right I'm not maximal for democracy actually like liberalism more than I like democracy right so I want my democracy to stay within the confines of liberal values

>> that's nice so let's make your

>> it is nice it's made all of this it's made the best countries on the America the country you hate apparently and don't think stands for anything. You must You want to go back to a time before America existed. You want to go back to the Byzantine Empire.

>> When When did I say anything?

>> You said this multiple times. I've listened to you say that literally.

>> I've known you for three years. I've known you since the big public.

>> You like to put $1,000 on the fact I've never said anything like going back to the Byzantine Empire. I'll bet you the Byzantine Empire was great.

>> Never even said that.

>> Really? You don't like the Byzantine Empire?

>> I Whether I do or don't doesn't mean I ever said that we should go back to it, does it?

>> Wait. Do you believe this is

>> Wait, wait, wait.

>> I'm not doing No, I'm not doing a bet with you.

>> Yeah. No, of course not.

>> Because I'm having a Wait. Well, first of all, I'm poor, so if I lose, I literally can't pay you, so there's no point. But second,

>> 500.

>> I I probably literally don't have 500.

>> 250.

>> I could maybe spend 100, but I'm not interested in making a bet with you.

>> Well, now I understand.

>> Well, this is this is the reason why I'm rejecting the bet is because you're doing the thing again where you're trying to catch me on like a couple of key words when I'm trying to talk about an idea. And so it's like if I say a few key words that like you don't like, we can correct them. But I would ask you, do you think the Byzantine Empire was good? Do you like it? Do you think that there's some level of what that empire was that we should try to adopt?

>> I think all systems have things which are valable.

>> You think we should try to adopt it into the American system?

>> No, not the Byzantine Empire. No, of course not.

>> What What empire would you like to see?

>> Well, I don't see you see how you just loaded that. Why would I

>> Why would I want to see an empire?

>> I can I can unload it.

>> What uh states craft would you like to see?

>> Yeah. So, I'm glad that you asked. Now that we understand, I I feel like after letting you talk here for a while, I actually understand a much broader base for your position.

>> Took three hours for you to get there. Congrats.

>> Well, you don't stop talking.

>> I made I stopped talking lots and I've made it pretty simple. You just

>> I've been I've been letting you go and go and go. So, now we can get to the I have I've been letting you go and go and go. I just asked you a few questions. Ditto, right?

>> I mean, I've tried to internally critique you. I don't really want it. Keep running away from it. Christian

>> and then being bad faith and being like, "Oh, yeah. I actually don't think God exists. Let's all assume."

>> I I know I'm terrible, but

>> I don't think you're terrible.

>> So now, now we've gotten to Christian.

>> Just so it's clear. I just want to be clear. I don't think Andrew,

>> can I can I say a word?

>> Well, I don't want people walking around thinking,

>> "Can I say anything in this debate?"

>> Do you think that I think you're terrible?

>> No. Eerite, who cares?

>> You said it.

>> Oh my god. Can we get back to the debate?

>> You said it.

>> Okay. Can we get back to the debate?

>> Well, do you think that I think you're terrible?

>> Oh my god. Who cares?

>> You said it.

>> Yeah, I do. I think you think Smoky Man bad. Yes.

>> Okay. I don't.

>> Okay. Great. So, anyway, back to the debate. I just want to make sure because you haven't actually answered this question. If Christian nationalists change the amendments of the Constitution, they changed them.

>> Mhm.

>> So, now Christian nationalists go first amendment, that's gone.

>> Right.

>> Gotcha. What the [ __ ] is wrong with doing that if it's in it if it's actually in the confines of the American system to do that?

>> So, as a Christian, I say it's uncchristian to do. That's nice. I'm asking about the political philosophy, remember?

>> So, uh, the Sure. Within the political philosophy, I would say I don't believe in absolute democracy. I believe in democracy that serves liberalism values because I think liberalism is the best political philosophy we received. So, if a nation state would vote in an authoritarian, which has actually happened many times. I think that's bad and I think the nation state has failed in that case. And I think that we should do our best with democracies to prevent the uh overtaking of radical.

>> That doesn't actually answer my question.

>> Sure, it does. Liberalism provides girds against that. I'm not for absolute democracy. So, In my liberal system, I would say

>> so who shouldn't vote?

>> What?

>> Who shouldn't vote?

>> I haven't said anything about who shouldn't vote.

>> Well, when you say absolute democracy, what does that mean?

>> So, uh like popular vote, like I don't want um just because somebody gets the most votes of people, I don't think that that should be the leader cuz like cities are more popular than

>> utilizing the system which is liberalism and is the American framework, Christian nationalists can get amendments passed in order to tailor things to Christianity.

>> They can. I just think that that's wrong for Christians to do.

>> Yeah, that's nice that you think that. But from a political philosophy, when you're talking about political philosophy, it is just utilizing liberalism.

>> Sure. But I would say that it's also unamerican to do because I think

>> yeah, how we've amendments against all of this

>> [ __ ] because we can go back to the beginning because I said the American ethos is built on things like ingenuity, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. And I think when you take over the first a nationalist and you make it so that people don't have free speech, they can only praise God, for example, I think that's unamerican because I think the uh founding fathers wrote it in intentionally to separate these things. They did not want to impose religion on other people. And I think that that's good and I think it's an American.

>> Why are they putting in an amendment system?

>> Because uh they recognize that over time they're like like technology and development occurs. So there are things that they haven't even thought of that might be relevant. For example, stakeholdership. They recognize

>> or like for example people are rejecting the status quo and they want to move outside of the idea of liberalism.

>> I think the founding fathers probably thought that democracy was good no matter what and that we should definitely try to stay.

>> That's really funny because they basically let nobody vote. Well, why if you want to go

>> didn't trust the electorate by their Yes. Oh, yes.

>> No.

>> Oh, yeah. 10,000%.

>> Okay, we can just go to Federalist number two. You're very wrong about this.

>> Oh, no. I'm very right. The Federalist Papers even are specific about this. There's a reason that they demanded that there be stakeholders in the nation. They actually did not trust the electorate. Even the stakeholders they had a large amount of distrust for.

>> Well, the issue what they actually had is they recognized that um different So, when we say stakeholders, we mean like people that have some stakes in the country, right? Yeah.

>> Okay. So the reason that they recognized is that different people would have different stakes in the country and so they were very concerned about people with very low stakes in the country to uh which was most people

>> but the stakes so land most people

>> so land owning was used as a proxy because they they thought if anyone is going to want to see America continue and America to flourish irrespective of what they personally want

>> then most people couldn't vote

>> it would be land owners.

>> Yeah.

>> Yeah. So most people couldn't vote.

>> I agree.

>> Yeah. For a reason. Well, I would say the reason was built on bad premises, right? They were concerned, for example, that the landless man would be less invest in invested in the country. And I would say there's a lot of people that don't own land. They're very patriotic. You got to interrupt me cuz I'm cooking, don't you?

>> Yeah. And under the Well, I got You got to be able to talk too.

>> You have lots.

>> I've barely said a word. For an hour, I've just let you prattle. It's my turn, too.

>> First of all, for the last hour, you've insisted on internally critiquing only me, and you wouldn't let me internally critique.

>> You can internally critique. you you can internally critique. But here's my question to you. I'm just curious because I still don't understand why it would be that if we changed an amendment that's anti-democratic or anti-liberal anti-democratic. I said that it would be unamerican.

>> It's not unamerican.

>> Yes, it is because the first

>> we've changed how many amendments?

>> Uh we've added a number of amendments. Yeah.

>> And changed them.

>> Sure. That's fine.

>> Like for instance, we added we added women's suffrage. We had an amendment for prohibition and then we got rid of the amendment for prohibition. We've added and taken away many amendments. The American system is actually a hodgepodge, isn't it?

>> Yeah. And I think that's one of the beauties of it. But I think like one of the things that are central to the American dream, the thing that makes America stick out, which makes it the unique country that it was so unique actually that when other monarchies fell, they adopted similar structures to us is things like free speech, like life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Thomas Jefferson and the founding fathers looked at at the world and said we need a government system that's for the common man and reduces the capacity liberalism built into the liberalism the idea of the guard rail bumpers right checks and balances

>> if the population gets the right to vote which it now has it has almost totally universal suffrage except in very minimal cases

>> then passing these amendments becomes much easier based on the agenda of the people that's within the because at that point you can consolidate power blocks in parties which was an emergent property of universal suffrage. Um, so the issue is when you have these two parties, why would you be more likely to pass an amendment when amendments actually require a large amount of votes, right? You can't just, it's not just 50/50, right? I don't remember what

>> because if you have two parties, you're probably going to have a lot of your politicians under one party flag or the other,

>> right? You want them to work together. It's a separation of power.

>> No, unless one has overwhelming control, which can easily happen.

>> Yes. But it's actually interesting when you look at like the creation of the United States. They went back and back to this. I just want to make sure

>> you don't want to deal with any facts of the reality.

>> When you have if you have an overwhelming amount of a single party who's in charge, right, then getting things passed is much much easier.

>> Sure, it absolutely is much easier. But this is why, for example, we've done things like splitting the Senate so that you need like 60 votes to try to prevent like true partisan voting.

>> They can into they can end the filibuster.

>> They could. They probably won't, which is unfortunate, but they could.

>> They may. And the thing is they can also pack the court. That's all within the confines of liberalism.

>> I agree. The very idea here that we can't utilize liberalism to remove parts of li of the liberal framework that we don't like

>> is well then there can be no it's not unamerican it's the most I would say it's unamerican to reduce get rid of some of the most foundational things which is like the pursuit of life and happiness I think that if we do things like that it's not it's not getting rid of any of those

>> hold on you can do that but if for example Christian nationalists took power and they wanted to get rid of the first amendment I would say that that is a violation of life, liberty, that's a big violation of liberty, which would be unamerican. I would say those Christian nationalists are unamerican. They don't believe in the ethos that made the state great, which was the common man gets a say that he has his rights protected.

>> Would you say the same thing about the Second Amendment?

>> Uh, yeah, I actually like the Second Amendment.

>> Great. So, I I should be able to own a bazooka.

>> Uh, potentially. I just think like all of the like natural limits to it are

>> What are natural limits?

>> Uh, most people can't afford it. Um, they like storage, for example, I think to store it.

>> They're within Yeah, they're within the confines. Sure, but I think a state would regulate a lot on like what you can like do with it.

>> Wait a wait a second. I'm a Canadian.

>> Wait, are you against 2A?

>> Are you saying Are you Are you against 2A?

>> Are you saying No, no. I'm a big Second Amendment.

>> So, should you be able to own a bazooka?

>> Sure.

>> Okay. Why?

>> Absolutely. Well, because it's within the confines of the right.

>> Why does that matter though? What if we voted to get rid of that?

>> Yeah. I believe in the right of self-defense.

>> Well, what if we voted to get rid of that?

>> Then that would be within the confines of the liberal framework.

>> Would that be okay with you?

>> Okay. No. I would object on different grounds though. I'm not a liberal.

>> Sure. Yeah, of course. I would object.

>> The liberal though, right? That's within the confines of the framework to completely eliminate the Second Amendment.

>> Sure. I I've never rejected that. I've said that it would be unamerican to

>> How's that unamerican?

>> Because I think like 2A for example, gun gun culture is extremely American. It's a deeply deeply American value.

>> Sure, I would agree with that. But what's not unamerican is removing amendments that Americans don't like. That's the most American thing.

>> Um, sure.

>> The most American thing is Americans introducing things and amendments that they like. It's getting rid of amendments that they don't like. It's doing things that they [ __ ] want based on what it is that they want. And so if Americans say we want Christian nationalism and we'll impose various amendments for Christian nationalism, that is the most American thing.

>> I think if America goes back towards like a more theocratic state, I think it is fundamentally now have become something that isn't America anymore. I would be the person running around like Trump said based on what we need to make America the founding fathers and the entire founding fathers gave the states the ability to the entire point of the revolutionary war which was to break away from tyranny and to separate power so that the common man had a chance to exist and have a right to have a right to speak to those who

>> was great sloganering but the truth is the revolutionary war was about money the very first thing George Washington did was implement a tax very first thing he did was institute and it led to the whiskey rebellion he put a tax on whiskey. Do you think that like our founders who wanted uhortion taxes directly abortion taxes wanted us in any way to have a [ __ ] income tax because that is against life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? We're the most taxed country on planet earth. One of the most taxed on planet earth.

>> I don't think that's right. Most western liberal democracies are taxable.

>> If you went back if you went back to walk that one back, if you went back to our founders,

>> can we see if there's anybody that taxes more on income than America? I just want to fact check. You could.

>> It's not just income. one of the most taxed countries on planet earth. There's no other western liberal democracy.

>> I said, "One of the most." Yes. So anyway, the

>> You said the most, but yeah.

>> Okay, whatever. There's my qualifier.

>> Well, look, we can actually give grace to whatever. So anyway, back to this before you divert again cuz that's all you do is divert.

>> When it is the case,

>> not diverted. I'm answering all your question.

>> When it is the case that you move back to I I don't know, let's say 1,800, do you think that they would have allowed an income tax? Uh, I'm not sure. I have no idea. Probably not. I have no idea.

>> Do you think that the way that people are taxed right now that our founders fought for that?

>> Uh, sort of. Yes.

>> Yes.

>> Sort of. Yes. Because I think the thing that the founders cared about was that the common man gets a say on the policy.

>> They did not want an income tax

>> at all.

>> Okay. I don't think income tax by itself just breaks this entire American ethos. I don't think like it's just shattered. Right. So, I imagine

>> why not? Because like I said before,

>> it's a threat to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

>> How is it a threat to life and liberty?

>> Because they're directly taking an unaportioned tax from people.

>> How is that a Sorry. How is that a threat to life and liberty? I'll just ask you again.

>> Because don't you think that you need to have money in order to have liberty?

>> Sure. But in in case of liberties, this is things you get access to. So one of the things that taxes do is they give you access to things like free education.

>> Okay. Wait a second. The income, you can have sales taxes, things like that. That's constitutional. Yeah.

>> Initially there was no income tax in the constitution.

>> Sure.

>> Yeah. So why was that passed? Do you know?

>> Um probably because we needed to have greater government receipts so that we could pay for the things that we wanted that we collectively had decided would be better for

>> because of the monster of Jackal Island. It was written by a bunch of bankers essentially and Jackson was against it first and he killed

>> he was against the centralized

>> he killed the well because the bank wanted to create an income tax.

>> That's not actually just

>> it is actually true.

>> So so I agree that that's true. The what you're presuming though, you're trying to make it seem like Jackson was most opposed because of income tax. Jackson was most opposed to the central bank to the central bank specifically because he was concerned about government statesmen having access and control over economy. He wanted that to be separate separation.

>> He was concerned about debt. That's why one of the first things he did was pay ours off.

>> Okay. All it was all it was about debt.

>> So you'd agree that Jackson had multiple reasons for why he was opposed not just income tax.

>> Yeah. But in income tax would have made him lose his [ __ ] mind. So do you think that it is un it's the most so it's completely American to roll back the income tax. It's completely American to roll back all of these various amenities again. You're so what you're doing is you're saying liberalism and the and the process of democracy gives us the capacity to change rules and you're saying that's America

>> that's the most American.

>> No. So I'm arguing that the most American thing is the value of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, ingenuity, science,

>> but you keep equivocating because you and you say that's not foundationalism or that's not a foundation for my philosophy is life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. And then when I say the most American thing that we can do is the most is the sorry how is this

>> is the American thing that we always do and then you move back and forth between these two ideals as though they're interchangeable. My foundation's actually political ideology. No, my foundation's actually life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

>> I've never said both ways. Hold on, Andrew. So, you're Kyla,

>> you're being bad faith again.

>> God, you're being bad faith, Kyla, by saying I'm bad faith.

>> Good job. So, I have never said that my my moral system is life, liberty, and pursuit.

>> I didn't say moral system.

>> You did.

>> I'm I'm talking about no foundational system for for liberalism.

>> Uh for American uh for the American ethos, not for liberalism, whatever that is. No, I said the foundation for liberalism is some thing of balance of state power, right? There is uh strong institutions, protections of human rights and uh liberties and in modern liberalism especially some form of like welfare state or caretaking.

>> Now, so hold on. Can we just acknowledge right now that you are the one equivocating because you slipped

>> going to make sure that we have it.

>> Hold on. Just let me finish my thoughts.

>> Go ahead.

>> You were saying that my moral system is this life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. But I've never said that the foundation of America. foundation of America. And I said, "Yeah, that's the American ethos." And they said, "Yeah, liberalism." I said, "No, liberalism's foundation is these other things." So, you're the one equivocating. You're trying to

>> Let's make sure I'm not equivocating. When we reduce it down,

>> the thing that makes Christian nationalism unamerican is that it's a threat to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

>> That Christian nationalists, if they had their way, would impose Christian ethics and restrictions on people that they wouldn't accept. And I think realistically, Christian nationalists, if they had their full way, would usher in a theocracy. And theocracy is fundamentally unamerican.

>> Got it? Now let's say Christian nationalists are able to take power, okay, through their, you know, minations, uh, running for political office, guys like Fuentes, super popular, many people like this, they sway the electorate, the electorate puts them in office under the promise that they're going to change many of these things,

>> right?

>> I'd say those American people are not American.

>> I get it. They're not. They're very unamerican. These Americans are very unamerican and bad Christians. I get it. These guys get in office and all they do is this. They just immediately legislate that you can't be prostitutes. No prostitution, no pimping, no gay marriage. Right. That's all they do. They keep everything else equal. Right. Can you tell me why it would be that you would oppose that?

>> Um, typically in the criminalization of prostitution, we typically see that women are disproportionately abused as a result.

>> Well, how would it be unamerican, I guess? Um, I didn't say it would be unamerican.

>> Okay. But it's definitely in direct violation of this whole liberty thing, right?

>> Not necessarily. Right. Like prostitutes specifically. Are you

>> Yeah. But homosexuals, for instance.

>> So, are you also wanting to impose a law that homosexuals can't get married?

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. Then I would oppose that. Yeah.

>> Yeah. Because it's a threat to liberty.

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. So, how come three people can't get married?

>> Uh, mostly I think right now it's taxation. I

>> Yeah. But I mean, if

>> if we can make a

>> if we can make it happen

>> legally, sure. I don't have a problem with it. Legally, cuz legality is not my moral system.

>> 17 people.

>> Uh, sure. I hold on. What What reasonable world exists where 17 people are getting legally married?

>> Well, right now, we just recently had three people who got married. I don't see why you couldn't add a fourth or a fifth. I

>> I'm saying, do you think it's reasonable to presume that 17 people are going to get married?

>> Yes.

>> Really?

>> Yes.

>> Okay. I think you're absurd.

>> I at least think it's reasonable to assume four or five would. So the thing is,

>> okay,

>> well, if if it's three, why can't it be four?

>> I've spent time with people, but maybe you haven't.

>> I don't know. If three people just got married, why couldn't it be four?

>> Well, I would argue, for example, in the case of polycules, even a lot of these relationships tend to fall apart because I I don't

>> But they can still get married

>> legally. Yeah.

>> Yeah. Okay. So, anyway,

>> so again, yes, if we could create a taxation system that could manage 17 people getting married legally, I don't have an issue with it necessarily.

>> Got it. Now,

>> but that's not more.

>> Now, hang on. Let's say that that we allow for we pass an amendment. Liberals pass an amendment and it says three people can get married. Okay? And this is now part of a new constitutional amendment. Christian nationalists get power. They remove that constitutional amendment. That is now violating the idea of liberty.

>> Now you're violating the idea, the very ideal of liberty. So that would be unamerican for those Christian nationalists to get rid of three people getting married if there was an amendment. Right?

>> So this is where plural pluralism comes in. You're making it seem as though like I'm a liberty extremist, right? I think that there are some liberties that can be like girded, right? I don't want people running around maximally doing anything they want at any given time and neither does liberalism typically because liberalism is also

>> where do we draw the threshold then because your whole objection to Christian nationalists gay marriage probably three because I don't think taxation would ever be functional for

>> Okay. So they pass an amendment three people can get married. That's what I said.

>> True.

>> And and then Christian nationalists take control and the only thing that they remove is that amendment.

>> I probably personally wouldn't have an issue with it

>> but that that's a threat to liberty. that's hurting people's liberty.

>> I don't I don't think necessarily.

>> How is it not necessarily hurting their liberty?

>> Because I'm not a liberty maximalist, which is what you're trying to

>> So what

>> what do you mean?

>> It still it would still be hurting their liberty whether you're a maximalist or not.

>> So for example, the reason why we might not allow three people to get married legally is because it may create situations where people like divorce situations can't be like easily solved. It makes divorces extremely messy particularly because manages the divorce. Yeah.

>> So the issue is now your hypothetical is going imagine we exist in a world that is fundamentally not in any way like the world that we exist now and I'm like I don't know in this fundamental world where like human beings don't

>> three people just got married. If three people can get married then those three people can already get divorced and if they have children those three people can already have some kind of custodial [ __ ] problem with

>> they already have major custodial issues issues within divorce court. is increas

>> so how would that not be a threat to liberty

>> well we might not allow this liberty because it actually the divorce courts and the way that the system works it limits people in such a way that we can't actually function

>> so then Christian nationalists going in and limiting liberty is not really a problem

>> to some extent yeah

>> to some extent so them outlying gay marriage that's a problem but not three people getting married why

>> because I would say consensually as a society we've agreed that gay people can get legally

>> so if cons no we never did there was no vote on that We voted for the electorate that did this.

>> Okay. And you're voting for the electorate who goes in and undoes it. So what?

>> Uh I would say that that opposite that in this case the only reason that you're doing that is because you think being gay is evil. So

>> I think that that's wrong to police.

>> That's nice you think that. But they were elected. They got in they got into office.

>> It's not nice that I think that I would say that Thank you. I would say that it's fundamentally uncchristian for them to do because now at this point they are not imposing something like

>> but your liberalism can't your liberalism can't actually stop at one matter to any argument

>> it it is not unamerican for them to go in and change amendments that's the most American

>> we're just back here again so what I would say is that there are some things that are central to the American ethos right but these things are not uh maximalist so what you're trying to do is you're trying to say well you're for liberty you're for maximal liberty and I'm like no I'm for some limitations on course you are because you're going What about 17 people? And I'm like, I don't know. I don't live in a world where that's even like kind of functionally reasonable. I don't know what I think about 17 people getting married at a legal level.

>> Just three.

>> Sure. Even just three. I'm not even sure what I think about three people getting married legally because I think that there's going to be a lot of complications as far as like how we manage these things necessarily because I'm not a liberty absolutist. But I do think that the value of liberty, giving common man access to these choices is central to the American equal. What would be wrong with Christian nationalists going in, right? Pack they pack the court and then they go ahead and re or don't even pack the court. They just put they just put they just put two Supreme Court justices, new ones on. They reinterpret that uh well, you know what? Gays actually can't get married. They over they overturn a burgerfell.

>> Uh one of my issues would be them intentionally packing the court. I think

>> No, I just took that off the table. They just put in two new Supreme Court justices. That's it.

>> How do they do that?

>> Because two of them die.

>> Uh okay, so two of them die. They they elect two of them with the intention of packing the court. So they're specifically selecting

>> forget packing the court.

>> Do they select them on the basis that these judges will be Christian as well and and and and make

>> they're selecting them because the party in charge wants them that.

>> Yeah. I think that that's the bad point already because I do not think that we should be putting

>> that's how parties do it now. They put in justices that they want that they think are going to represent their views.

>> Do you think that I like the fact that we try to make the uh judicial system uh partisan? That's very unAmerican. I

>> I think it is unamerican.

>> No, it's very unamerican for you to go against that.

>> Why?

>> Because it's the most American thing. That's how we've always done it.

>> I would say I would say that if it's not gingerting the the common man, the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness, packing the courts, for example, I think is bad. I think that this is not a good thing to do. I don't want partisan courts. The point hold on the American the American idea, the zeitgeist of the separation of powers actually really, really, really matters because one of the things that's fundamental to Americanism is the opposition of tyranny. And how you oppose tyranny is you separate power. So if you're packing the court to be biased towards a single side, you're already engaging in some of

>> What about them getting rid of abortion?

>> What about it?

>> Yeah. Does that is that hurting life or helping life?

>> Uh depends on what you think life is.

>> Well, I'm asking you.

>> Uh so I'm for the decriminalization of abortion entirely because I think when you look at the actual Yeah. When you look at the ramifications of abortion policy, it leads to more infant deaths, more mother deaths, more children in foster care, more children in poverty, and more children. more or less American that abortion's banned.

>> I I don't think that this is necessarily an American concept. Not everything is is like tied to the

>> So if Christian nationalists get in and they completely outlaw abortion, right, via constitutional amendment,

>> I think that they would then be imposing onto non-Christians their view of human life.

>> That's nice. But that doesn't violate any of the life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness that you consider Americanism to be. It reinforces life. It would be because probably 50 I think it's like 50% of the population definitely disagrees with the contention of when life is.

>> Who cares? You're not an extremist. The main thing is that if it's the case

>> What do you mean who cares?

>> Well, first of all,

>> probably the the voting electoral.

>> Yeah, sure. The ones who elected the Christian nationalists.

>> Uh well, more so in this case, the ones who didn't.

>> So now the Christian there's it's the most American thing possible when Christian nationalists get in. How's that tyranny? by by trying to impose only Christian ethics on other people, knowing for a fact that 50% of the population would not want to adhere to

>> 50% of the population doesn't want to adhere to abortion. They think that abortions

>> they don't have to get abortions. Isn't that crazy?

>> They think you're murdering people.

>> Sure, but they don't have to get an abortion. It

>> doesn't matter. You're not allowed to murder people.

>> Wait, does the state compel anyone to get an abortion?

>> Why would that matter?

>> Because it kind of matters if you're talking about the Christian. Is it the case that if the state said that you could like murder random people that you could object to that in a democracy?

>> Uh yes.

>> So you can object to [ __ ] people murdering people in your democracy.

>> You can of course

>> and you can get an amendment together to say stop murdering people.

>> No, this is fine as long as the reason that Christians aren't doing it is intentionally to impose Christian ethics on non-Christians.

>> And yet you have not made an argument for why that's even bad. You've just said within the framework like No, no, no. I said no. I said Christians imposing Christian ethics on non-Christians is unbiblical. It's heretical to do.

>> Yeah, we're talking about whether or not it's unamerican.

>> No, I've said from the beginning.

>> Now you're going to [ __ ] equivocate. We're talking about what's unamerican 5 seconds ago.

>> You trying to slant me into specific types of arguments that I'm not making. It's equivocating.

>> No, you said that this is this is the most American thing we could do.

>> What?

>> To outlaw abortion for for the purpose of life. Arerodite. The purpose of life. I said this.

>> No, no, no. We're talking about what's unamerican or American. I'm postulating that it's the most American thing we can do if the idea is life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness for Christian nationalists to outlaw abortion.

>> Do you think it would be also super American to get rid of uh evolution in in class?

>> I don't know if that would be American or not American.

>> Well, Christian nationalists would probably want to do it. Is that American or not?

>> I don't think that they would.

>> Would they? What do you mean? They've lit they've multiple times advocated for removal of evolution from the Louisiana Act of 2008. I think that that should be left up to the states like the 10th amendment says.

>> Okay.
