So there are no Christian values in modern liberalism. It's just an appeal to a system.

>> Sure. But the system doesn't have to be. So my argument basically say I don't think that Christian uh rule should be utilized as statecraft. I think separation of church and state is one of the most fundamentally important things not just for a state but more so for a Christian.

>> That's an claim. You agree?

>> Sure.

>> Okay. Were you driving that?

>> Uh from my faith.

>> So your faith tells you that Christians should be liberal.

>> No. I said that the separation of church and state.

>> So your Christian values tell you that Christians should not be in charge of states.

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. And um do you think that Christians who were in charge of states before were wrong?

>> Yeah.

>> You do?

>> Mhm.

>> Okay. Which ones?

>> Um all the ones that came after Jesus and did it.

>> So you you think that historically they just got it all wrong?

>> Yeah. I think that like if you look for example at like if you I mean we can get into the typological argument here but if you look at like all of the history of the Bible for example um what we see over time is when we go from the Old Testament to New Testament and for those cuz I'm not trying to do a pop quiz just for those who are listening that don't know what a typological it's just like a type we're looking at types typically from Old Testament to New Testament it's a pretty standard like apologetics or a theological argument that kids made. So when you look for example through the Old Testament, we have multiple periods that I'm sure you would agree to. Judges, kings, priests. Agreed?

>> Mhm.

>> Okay. So what we see is basically a blending a high blending of of state craft and faith that gets reduced over time with the uh final answer of Jesus who actually actively and aggressively rejects statethood, rejects politics, and rejects any kingmanship. In fact, that's a large reason, not the only reason, but a large reason why the Jews felt that he was not the Messiah is because they didn't see a physical political kingdom unifying um the northern and southern kingdoms.

>> Okay. So, back to the O claim, Christians ought not uh be in charge of governments and government systems.

>> It depends on what you mean when you're saying that.

>> Well, you said that uh that Christians ought not do that, right? I don't think that Christians should try to push for a blending of church and state.

>> Okay. And does state need to be a nation?

>> When I say state, I mean a nation.

>> So how come it's only at the n national level?

>> Well, I it would be at the I guess when I say so when I say nation, I guess I should say governmental level. I don't want uh and when I say this, I don't mean that Christians can't be a government official. Christians should not impose Christian ethics into rule of law. I have not I don't know. I don't haven't thought about tribes.

>> But there's governments, right?

>> Not really. Not like meaningful.

>> Why is that not meaningful?

>> I would not say that anyone who's like a political philosopher would look at a tribe and call that a government. Usually when we mean government, we mean post the invention of the nation.

>> What about a nation city?

>> Yeah. Nation state.

>> That's not well a nation city. Let's say

>> the city itself

>> if there's like a formalized Roman like to some degree like if there's a formalized actual government not just like a tribe then sure potentially but again I would need to know what we're talking about here I need like more specific examples

>> like you have a city that has 100,000 people in it

>> and they they have a government there right that government should not uh mix church and state

>> yeah they shouldn't rule with Christian ethics as a thing that makes laws

>> okay What should they rule with?

>> Uh, consensus cuz I like democracy.

>> Consensus.

>> Yeah.

>> Okay.

>> And and more importantly, laws have to be what works.

>> And what happens when the consensus says kill babies?

>> Well, that would be against like what works, right?

>> No.

>> Yeah. It's a nation is not going to work very well if they kill other babies.

>> A nation would work just fine if they kill other people's babies.

>> Uh, no. Cuz that nation would be then a target for probably war, not just from that nation, but probably neighboring nations. cuz it seems like in general most people have this emergent value of not killing babies.

>> Okay. I don't understand. Let's say that for like 100 years a nation kills every third baby that comes up in the nation. It's like overpop populated. So they just take a rock and bash its [ __ ] brains in. I don't how China as an example.

>> How's that not working?

>> Oh, it seems like it was really really bad for China. It seems like it was really bad for the fact that people don't like seeing dead babies skewed everywhere. Uh it seems like it crushed their population.

>> As long as the nation though consents to that. Well, it's not just about what the nation consents to, right?

>> Yes. You said, and your exact words, I wrote them down. They should rule via consent because I like consent because I like democracy.

>> Yeah. So, when I say rule by consent, that doesn't mean that states craftmen aren't imposing laws that are reasonable and work, right? The law is about like what makes a state work.

>> Yeah. But there's no contradiction in how the state would not work if they killed every third child.

>> How would that state logistically work? I feel like that state

>> it would work fine. They used to do it all the time. They used to sacrifice children all the time inside of Rome, inside of many states, and it worked just fine.

>> Well, not really. Like I would Well, I would argue a lot of the Where are Where are those nation states?

>> They lasted a lot longer than America, some of them.

>> Where are they?

>> Well, are you saying that? So, that's a facious argument. You saying because this didn't continue in perpetuity, that means it didn't work. that I could just say, well, don't you agree that America as it exists right now is not going to exist in perpetuity. Therefore, it doesn't work

>> probably because there theoretically and hopefully there'll be better systems that emerge.

>> Okay, so then it doesn't work

>> uh by and large, no, not by what I mean.

>> What? Okay, so I just want to make sure.

>> So Rome didn't fall, right, just because of one thing. But when we look at, for example, a nation that kills every third baby,

>> you grab me another beer while you're up.

>> This probably wouldn't work for a number of reasons. Number one, citizens don't like killing their babies. But if they did,

>> they don't.

>> Yeah. But if they did,

>> they don't. I don't.

>> Yeah. But if they did,

>> what what what person enjoys killing their babies?

>> Like a pagan nation, let's say,

>> I I would basically argue that they don't enjoy killing their babies either. Usually, like even when you look at pagan nations where babies are killed, right? Oftent times when you can find evidence for it, the mother of that child, for example, or the father of that child are completely opposed to it. It's usually forced upon them, right? They don't enjoy it necessarily. And usually the child sacrifice was occurring.

>> But if there's consensus, what grounds would you oppose the consensus? what makes the state work best for most of the people.

>> Yeah. And most people have now given you consensus that this is working best for us.

>> They you can't give consensus that this is working for us. We actually have to look at like material like outcomes, right? So for example, how we know that America's law system works pretty well although there are problems is the fact that our military is the strongest, we have the most amount of scientific output, which is awesome, right? That we are the number one currency in the world, the largest like thing. So we know okay the system that we centrally kind of erected around for the most part works pretty well. It's a pretty competitive system.

>> Okay. But that's post hawk. Does do you agree with me that it takes time for you to gather data on a system which is implemented?

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. So for years so for 5 years we have a consensus that we kill every third baby and the people go along with it and they adore it. They think it's great. We don't have the data to show them how wrongheaded they are yet.

>> I don't think that would emerge. So, okay. But it has emerged.

>> I I think it's

>> But it has not. No, it has not.

>> Yes, it definitely has. There's definitely been many nations where they kill their children, including China. So, I don't know what you're talking about,

>> but it didn't work. In fact, one of the

>> Yeah, it you that's post hawk. That's you post hawking. It didn't work after the fact. We're talking about in the fact that's how you develop state

>> in the fact though.

>> In when it's happening.

>> Yeah.

>> What are you appealing to to oppose it?

>> Me personally.

>> Yeah.

>> Oh, me personally. Well, I would define command theorist. I would say that murdering babies is wrong.

>> Okay. Gotcha.

>> Yeah.

>> So, the consensus would be wrong.

>> Uh against my morals. Yeah.

>> Okay. So, you hold so you hold a form of dualism.

>> Uh no, this is would be relativism.

>> Well, d Well, not really.

>> It's not relativism. It's relativistic is probably the better.

>> Relativistic perhaps, but it's this sounds like dual ethics.

>> No, it's just relativist. relativistic.

>> Well, why is consensus

>> good?

>> It's not ontologically good.

>> Okay, good. So,

>> I think it makes the most I think for the most part Well, I can answer you.

>> All right,

>> breathe. You're going to be okay. So, for the most part, I think that for example, consensus is good because it's worked. I think it's worked in so far as America mostly has a democratic consensus type system, which has worked pretty damn well. I think the world outside is pretty good. There are a lot of problems that people will point to, but I think America overall is a pretty good nation. I think most western liberal democracies are better than we've ever developed any at any time in history.

>> So the grounds that you would oppose a consensus of killing every third baby would be Christian ethics, right?

>> Well, it would probably be multiple things. Yeah. That I would appeal to. Like I would use multiple evidences for it.

>> Well,

>> the reason I personally wouldn't kill babies is because I think it's wrong to murder babies.

>> Okay. Gotcha.

>> Do you think it's wrong to murder babies?

>> But if there was a consensus Well, yeah, of course. But if there was a consensus, you said that's the thing that we should run things by is by consensus.

>> That might become state law. But I'm saying to you a I think that would fall out of state law very quickly and I would probably be a person who would advocate strongly against that state law because not all state laws are moral

>> based on your morality

>> to some degree. But I wouldn't be imposing my morality on

>> What if the consensus is that you're not allowed to oppose the consensus?

>> Like an authoritarian regime?

>> Well, no, that wouldn't be authoritarian. That would be democratic. Uh, how so?

>> Because you can democratically vote in laws which are oppressive.

>> Sorry. So I I feel like you're just making something into democracy that doesn't exist. Could you explain it more?

>> Yeah. If everybody votes tomorrow in a democracy that Kyla can never say another [ __ ] word or else I don't know, she gets beat to death with a rock.

>> I would have due process.

>> Okay. Well, the thing is

>> and I could argue free speech that violates my amendment.

>> Hang on. You didn't say due process. You said consensus is how we should rule.

>> Consensus is typically how we select for like electoral people and then electoral people are hopefully although not always supposed to be educated in such a way that they can make state craft policies that brings about most good for citizens because I don't think state craft is in and of itself moral.

>> Okay. So we're not actually appealing to consensus for how we should run things then.

>> Well to some degree because the stakeholder is the voter. So to some degree you have to appeal to what stakeholders believe. What's preventing what's preventing voters in a liberal democracy from voting in laws which go against your morals?

>> Well, I would basically I would argue that God puts like a sense of conscious within each of us. And I don't think that almost anyone actually emerges in such a way that they say it's good to kill babies. I think for example, pagan institutions did erect very historically and you will notice that they don't exist anymore because they don't work very well and people don't like them. And I also would argue that they were moral at the time, right? And so in the case of state craft, we would use consensus to vote in elected representatives and these elected representatives would impose laws. But if we don't agree with those laws, then we can oust that person.

>> That's not my question. My question is what actually prevents inside of a liberal society from people utilizing consensus in order to pass laws which are immoral

>> from your view?

>> Immoral from my view? Yeah.

>> Nothing. But I don't think that every Wait, I don't think that all of my moral system should be rule of law.

>> I understand.

>> Do you think that

>> all I'm doing is is making sure that I get the that I get it right.

>> Can I ask you a question?

>> Yes.

>> Do you think that

>> Before you do, I'm going to interrogate the position, then you can interrogate mine.

>> I would just like to have some back and forth.

>> That's the fair way to do it. But the problem is is you just divert.

>> Wait, no. That's the first conversation we had, the first like segment.

>> I don't care about the meta. Just let me finish the interrogation dropping the meta because you're doing some you're doing like I want How's it bad faith to want to interrogate

>> I haven't said you can interrogate my position. I said can you wait for a second so I can ask you some questions because in the case I was interrogating your worldview with the first prompt. I also allowed you to interrogate my worldview in return.

>> Let's let me do the interrogation first and then you can do your second.

>> Okay. So do you think that we should

>> No. No. I said let me do my interrogation first. You can do your second. I'm saying I would like a back and forth.

>> But all that does is derail from the questions I have.

>> Uh derails from the dunk that you're trying to lead me into. I understand that it does that. Well, because what you're trying to do is to get to some foundational thing of being like, see, it's born on nothing. It's like, okay, Andrew, that's what's bad faith.

>> Do you want to just not allowing your position,

>> everyone knows that this is what's happening?

>> Wait, you're So you're saying that your position when it's interrogated foundation is going to be incoherent? I would say every single foundation of any worldview normative or meta ethics is unjustifiable. Yes. This is what axioms are.

>> Oh, really?

>> They all fail a grip trila. Yes.

>> Because because of a gria's trilmma.

>> How do you not feel a gria's trilmma?

>> Oh man, that's really weird. What? Tell me again. What does a grippa trillemma say?

>> It's dogmatism. All all justification systems fail at a foundational level because they will fail in one of three ways or all of three ways. Dogmatism, infinite regression, and circular reasoning.

>> Is that position justified? No.

>> Okay. So, anyway, back to this.

>> Wait, so you run away from a gri

>> Okay, you know what?

>> I ran I ran away from it.

>> Yeah.

>> You just said that a grippa's trilmma is not a justified position.

>> Well, what do you mean by justified?

>> Well, whatever you mean by it in a grippa's trilmma.

>> Well, it's a it's an internal critique of justification systems. A grippa, what do you mean is a grippa trillemma unjustified? It is a philosophical tool that we can utilize to understand that at a foundational level, no belief systems. How do you solve a grippers truth?

>> How do you solve a grius

>> dilemma? Well, it's self-refuting. This has been known for a thousand years. I don't know if you know this or not. It's a self-refuting. A grippers trilm self-refuting. If

>> so, how do you not engage in dogmatism?

>> If all things are axiomatic, right? Assume

>> the reduction to a aimatic. Are we making a truth claim?

>> Uh, you are making a truth claim.

>> Okay. And is that truth claim justified?

>> No.

>> Yeah, cuz you assume. Wait, are you not making a truth claim?

>> It doesn't matter.

>> Of course it does. Are you not making truth claims?

>> Oh, wait a second.

>> Does your moral system not utilize truth claims?

>> Did you posit an argument to me?

>> Which was a Grippa's trilmma?

>> Yep.

>> And was that argument justified?

>> Uh, no.

>> No. More than any Wait, is your arguments justified?

>> That what does that have to do with you?

>> I'm internally critiquing you this.

>> You can internally critique me with your argument.

>> How are you not? Yeah. So, I said, "How do you not fail a Grippa's trillemma?" And you said, "A Grippa's trilmma doesn't matter." That's not how you solve a say it doesn't matter. He said it's unjustified.

>> Well, it's self-refuting.

>> How is it self-refuting?

>> Because if you claim that there you're you're making a truth claim that's unjustified, then you're not making a truth claim.

>> Sure, you are. You're just assuming a grim I guess engages in dogmatism.

>> It's not justified.

>> Yeah. So, a grippers trilem, I suppose, engages in dogmatism itself. But how is it self-refuting?

>> You just explained it.

>> Every single system is self-refuting them by this law.

>> Is that a truth claim?

>> Yes.

>> Okay. Okay. And does that fail because of a Grippa's trilmma? So, should I take anything you say seriously? Because

>> give me give me a single truth.

>> I don't have to make your argument.

>> I was going to run from this one again. Watch. Give me a single truth claim that doesn't fail a Gria's trilmma. Go.

>> Okay. First of all, back up. Whose argument is this?

>> Give me a single truth claim that doesn't frier dilemma. I knew you were going to weasel in this one. I'm just going to stay here.

>> Okay, stay here. Whose argument is it

>> right now? Both of us. We're both Wait a second.

>> Are we both having a conversation? You didn't argue that a grippa triilma is true. You did.

>> I said it's true in like an assumed way in the way that all things are assumed.

>> And actually,

>> so is it true or not?

>> Uh, it's true in like a I suppose like Yeah. True in the way that we mean true for everything else that's true.

>> What does that mean?

>> Well, give me an example.

>> Yeah, it's not my argument. You don't get to interrogate me for your argument.

>> No, no. I'm asking you for a counterfactual to prove your

>> I don't need to. It's your argument.

>> My argument is nothing is nothing is this thing you're saying. Can you provide me a counter?

>> So nothing's true.

>> I didn't say nothing's true. I said truths are true.

>> Truths are assumed.

>> Tautologies.

>> Truths are assumed. Tautology.

>> Do you know? Yeah. No. Truths are assumed. They're tautologies.

>> Truths are tautologies

>> oftentimes at a foundational level. Yeah.

>> Often or are

>> R. So is a grippa trillemma a truth tutology?

>> It's not an axiom. It's a philosophical system and it's a philosophical like uh equation how you test your own thinking. So how do you

>> and so okay I'm super confused.

>> Give me a truth claim that doesn't solve

>> you don't have to make your argument.

>> This isn't my argument. My argument is all arguments foundationally will fail a grip trma.

>> Okay. So you are making an argument.

>> You're saying that's not true.

>> I didn't say anything like that. I asked you how it was true.

>> Wait. So you're agreeing with me that no truth claim.

>> I didn't agree with anything.

>> So you have those are the options.

>> I don't have to do anything. You're making an argument.

>> Yes. You could be a coward and you could run away.

>> Cowardice. You posit that there's that grippa trillemma is true.

>> Yeah.

>> Okay.

>> And I'm saying that's assumed because all things are at a foundational level are assumed. And I said can you give me an example where true?

>> Yeah. God is dogmatism.

>> Okay. So you think

>> assuming God exists.

>> So when I ask you does god exist and you say yes that's not true.

>> It's true and I'm assuming it.

>> How is it true?

>> Uh it's true because I believe it's true.

>> I'm a divine command theorist.

>> So okay. So I just want to make sure I got this right.

>> How do you He's just going to run away from us.

>> When you when you pause it, well, you

>> you have to pay like 10 bucks to force this question.

>> How do you posit the arguments and then I I have to answer to the argument.

>> So, if I pose an argument and I give you the justification for my argument and it seems like the way that you're acting is that you think that that is incorrect, then you have to pose me a counter. So, I said, if I'm wrong, Andrew, you can just prove me wrong like that. Find me a truth claim that isn't fundamentally unjustifiable. Go ahead. How do you find me one truth that doesn't fail?

>> First of all,

>> who posits a Grippa's trillemma is true? Andrew or or Aerodite?

>> A Gria's trilmma uh isn't it? This is like this is like saying Uthifro Uthifro's dilemma is true. Is Uthifro's dilemma true?

>> Okay. Again, you Why are you asking me questions about your argument?

>> Because what you're doing I think you're I can't tell I can't tell if you genuinely don't understand a Grippa's trilmma maybe or if you're being bad faith. Those are the only two. How am I being bad faith when you pause an argument and I ask you about it?

>> Relax, Andrew. I said there's two options. You genuinely don't understand or you're being bad faith.

>> Well, there's a third option, which is maybe you don't understand.

>> I do understand how dilemmas work in philos.

>> Okay, then let's

>> are trolley problems true.

>> If a grippa's trilmma

>> is like a trolley problem.

>> Yeah. I'm just want to make sure a grip

>> it's a philosophical test of logic.

>> Okay, I got it. So, when you're talking about agria's trilmma, would you have a any criticisms for your for this argument that you're making?

>> I I can't solve it. That's the that's the point of the dilemma.

>> Okay. So when you say that the when I ask you is a Gria's trima true

>> I can't solve it.

>> Is it true though?

>> Is a trolley problem true? Is the fro's dilemma true? What are we doing right now?

>> Yeah. I think I think philosophically you can you can say that the conclusion is true or false?

>> No. No. A grippa's trilmma isn't a conclusion. A grippa's trilmma is a problem. It's a philosophical problem. Is Uthifro's dilemma true?

>> Wait wait wait. I'm not talking about I'm talking about a grippa trillemma. Yeah, it's a problem in the same way that you Utherfro's dilemma is.

>> Okay. So, walk me true.

>> Walk me through a Grippa's dile dilemma. I'll make sure I understand it.

>> Okay. Grippa's trima posits that no beliefs are justifiable foundationally because they will fail one of three ways. Dogmatism, infinite regression, or circularity. And I'm saying, can you find me an example of a truth claim that doesn't fail a grip?

>> That sounds like that sounds to me like you're positing propositions in a conclusion. I'm giving you something similar to like a euthiferro dilemma or a trolley problem to see if you can solve it logically.

>> Yeah. Yeah. But that has nothing to do with with a grippa's trilmma which we're talking about. So

>> it has everything to do with trma because you're asking if it's true which is like asking me if trolley problems.

>> No, it's not.

>> Are trolley problems true?

>> If it's a if it's propositional, this sounds like propositional logic to me. You're actually giving me premises and a conclusion. Is the conclusion true?

>> This is not what's happening. It's a dilemma. Is the Euthifro dilemma true?

>> Well, that's a that's a whole different thing. These are onetoone comparison. This is the comparison I'm trying to make because I feel like you're not understanding what a dilemma is.

>> Write it out for me.

>> I I don't need to. Do you Wait, how do you solve youthro dilemma or do you think

>> right now I just want it written out so I can see if this is a non-propositional problem.

>> Okay. I'm just going to write out what I've said.

>> Okay. All foundational beliefs. Um,

>> private chat, Nathan, if you want to pull that up.

>> Viable. Yeah. Get get the TTS in here. Make Brian some money. Okay.

>> Oh, no. I was going to pull up a Grippa's trilmma.

>> Oh, so it's on screen

>> so people know what the heck you guys are talking about. Uh, go F11 with it. Nathan, do you have it?

>> Uh, okay. Can you It also goes by Munchhousen Trillemma. Uh, I guess

>> uh I would I would just look up specific Grio's trilmma.

>> Well, scroll down.

>> Just finish it while writing it. I want to see if it's proper.

>> Scroll down. Yeah, continue. Continue on though. Go ahead. Scroll down.

>> Uh, keep going. It says the name. Scroll down. It says so Munchhousen trillemma is also known as agria's trillemma. So I guess it's just a different name for it. Scroll back up.

>> Yes. So I'll read this here. Keep working on this. But the circular argument in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition. The regressive argument in which each proof requires a further proof add infinitum. The dogmatic argument which rests on accepted precepts which are merely asserted rather than defended.

>> The trillemma then is having to choose one of the three equally unsatisfying options.

>> Hopefully you can read that.

>> Sorry if you can't just tell me if you need me to rewrite something.

>> Uh circular argument, infinite regression or dogmatism. So then you believe in objective truth, right?

>> Uh I believe in objective morals. Yeah. And like uh scientific realism.

>> Are they objectively true? uh morals. Well, objectively like they exist outside of me.

>> Is that true?

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. What makes it true?

>> I'm assuming.

>> So, is everything you assume true?

>> No. But everything I assume is true cuz I'm really good at philosophy.

>> How do you solve All I'm asking

>> has nothing to do with me.

>> It does.

>> You can't. You don't believe.

>> So, here's what's happening. It doesn't. How do you solve Euththero's dilemma?

>> Why does that Why do I need to solve your problem? Because if I'm posing youthro's dilemma, a philosophical problem, you can't go is the problem true. That's not that's

>> I'm not even asking about that. That's sidestepping the conversation.

>> If you if you believe that this is correct and you also believe that objective morality is correct.

>> Yeah. Correct. Correct in the way that we're assuming a grippers. Correct in the way that like trolley problems are good at testing.

>> So we're just both making assumptions about everything.

>> Everyone is well that or you're infinitely regressing. Those are your two Well, there's your circular reasoning which is just tautology. So everyone's kind of doing tautology.

>> So we're just assuming God.

>> Yeah, of course.

>> Okay.

>> How do you how are you not?

>> So all these things, all of these things in philosophy are just going down to these three categories for you.

>> No, not these. These aren't categories. These are ways in which you're facious. Your thinking is facious. So it's saying all beliefs, all meta ethics, normative frameworks are fundamentally unjustifiable

>> because they can't solve for one of these three things. Thank you.

>> I see.

>> And I'm asking you how do you solve for that?

>> I can't. I'm going to adopt it. He's like, "Euthther's dilemma. I don't know. Can't find an answer."

>> No, no, no. I'm going to adopt it. You're right.

>> I'm just going to every I'm just going to assume everything's true because I assume it.

>> That's That's fine. But now

>> that's what you said.

>> Now you're in line with like So this is one of your issues.

>> That's what you said.

>> Yeah. Yeah. No, that's fine. Welcome to my world. Okay. Yeah, I'm in your world.

>> We're based over here. Okay. The issue is that I wouldn't go to secular people and be like, "You don't have a moral ethical system because it's unjustifiable." Because I already know that mine's unjustifiable. I'm assuming I'm doing dogmatism and they're doing usually infinite regression

>> or they're being cowards and they're being like I don't know.

>> So then you can't make a justification for why I shouldn't like pull out a machine gun and kill everybody.

>> This these are not the same thing you Yeah. So when I'm talking about foundational beliefs

>> Yeah.

>> pop quiz. What's foundational? Do you know what foundationalism is?

>> Yeah. The it's going to be the pillar in which a belief stands on.

>> Yeah. Okay. So not all statements or beliefs pop. You're welcome. Well, I don't actually do pop quizzes. I usually ask your whole debate style, but go ahead.

>> It's not me knowing more information than you is not like some some some crazy like maniacal tactic. And

>> when we get to the point where you do,

>> this is the issue, Andrew, is it speaks to your insecurity that when I ask you questions about whether or not you know something, I'm asking in genuine good faith because they're like esoteric and I don't expect people to know them. But you take it as an insult to like your pride or something like that. Of course, because you think I'm doing something like maniacal when it's like me asking you, "Do you know what a grippers trilma is?" isn't to say, "Huh, idiot. You don't know anything about griosph." It's for me to go, "Okay, if you don't, let me explain it to you and then I'm curious how you would reason through it."

>> Yeah. I would just reason that I'll adopt it and anybody that I decide to impose my will on can't actually say that I'm unjustified.

>> Of course you can.

>> How?

>> Well, you wouldn't say that your foundations are unjustified, but they would say, for example, here's a list of evidences and arguments as to why I don't think

>> Yeah, but none of those are justified. They're all

>> built off of tutologies.

>> So what? Everything's built off of

>> there's no justification. Tell me you can't do anything.

>> Wait, do you think math doesn't exist? Because

>> what does that have to do with what we're talking about?

>> Math is tautological.

>> Oh my god.

>> Wait, do you not know that?

>> What is the just time? Do you know that math is how can you tell me? You see what I mean? Pop quiz.

>> Well, I'm doing it now cuz you're just being ridiculous.

>> Squirrel brain. Can you tell me

>> I'm pretty focused. Can you tell me tell me how it is then that you can create any justifications that anybody's ever doing anything wrong?

>> Logic and reason. You build on top of like tautological axioms that seem reasonable based on kind of assumptions but they seem reasonable and you build upon an entire structural of world belief which is what

>> none of them are justified

>> at a foundational level. No, all beliefs are unjustifiable.

>> Well then you you don't

>> how do you solve dogmatism when you just told me then that I can't go to secular people and tell them that their beliefs are unjustified.

>> You can't and be co and be consistent.

>> So then we should just throw philosophy out.

>> No.

>> Why not? It's not justified

>> uh at a rational level. It's just a tautology that we make up

>> because people accept tautologies because that's how you think about the world, right? Like math, we just accept tautologies in math. We have to because you have no starting point if you don't. So we assume these things and then we build on top of them and then the beauty of things like math and science in the case of like um you know science realism is you can use math and these things to observe and test and see if you're actually mapping onto the correctness of the world.

>> I see. Yeah. So then if I inductive and

>> So then if I utilize the assumption that God is real, this would dogmatism. Yeah.

>> Yeah. This would satisfy you because you also use the assumption that God is real.

>> I'll just grant it. Of course I always.

>> So then if that's if that's the case and we assume that God's real and then we assume God's commands and then we build our case off of that. Yeah.

>> That that's justified as justified as something can be.

>> Yeah.

>> Okay. Well then I don't know what we're arguing about. We'll just do that.
