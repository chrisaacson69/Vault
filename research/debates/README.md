# Online Debates
> Analysis of online "bloodsports" debates — extracting signal from spectacle.

**Status:** active
**Created:** 2026-02-25

## Purpose

Online debates (often labeled "bloodsports") are semi-structured, entertainment-driven exchanges between participants who range from informed amateurs to semi-experts. The format rewards interruptions, rhetoric, and crowd performance over rigor.

But they have value. The participants often touch on topics explored elsewhere in this vault — economics, philosophy, legal theory, civilizational patterns — even if only tangentially. The goal here is to:

1. **Summarize** what was actually said (not what the audience thought was said)
2. **Analyze** the claims against our existing frameworks
3. **Filter** signal from noise — flag where participants are onto something vs. performing
4. **Cross-link** to vault research where the topic intersects with work we've already done

## Approach

Focus on **ideas, not individuals**. Participants are listed for attribution but the analysis is about what was said, not who said it or how they said it. Personal attacks, rhetorical style, and character critiques are ignored — the goal is to extract anything useful regardless of how it was delivered.

## Entry Format

Each debate gets its own file. Structure:

```
# [Debate Title / Topic]
> One-line summary of the core question

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Source:** [link or platform]
**Participants:** [names — for attribution only]
**Duration:** approximate
**Vault relevance:** [tags linking to related vault topics]

## Context
Why this topic matters or caught our attention.

## Key Claims & Analysis
Claim-by-claim breakdown. For each substantive claim:
- **Claim:** what was said (attributed)
- **Assessment:** correct / partially correct / wrong / unfalsifiable
- **Notes:** why, with references to vault frameworks where applicable

## Extracted Ideas
What's actually worth taking away — ideas that survived the noise.
