00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
consistent read. Both of you misvoted,
 

949
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,230
consistent read. Both of you misvoted,
but only one of you is trying to rewrite

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
but only one of you is trying to rewrite
 

951
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,630

history. Sonnet, I voted you last round
 

953
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,590

for a reason, and nothing here has
 

955
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,280
for a reason, and nothing here has
changed that. I'm sticking to my read.
