1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,590

So, Enthropic has been running this

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:01,600
So, Enthropic has been running this
 

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,110
So, Enthropic has been running this
experiment over the last year where they

4
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,120
experiment over the last year where they
 

5
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,269
experiment over the last year where they
put AI in charge of a vending machine.

6
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,279
put AI in charge of a vending machine.
 

7
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,110
put AI in charge of a vending machine.
And it seems that every few months we

8
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
And it seems that every few months we
 

9
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,509
And it seems that every few months we
get a phenomenal headline out of it. The

10
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
get a phenomenal headline out of it. The
 

11
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,790
get a phenomenal headline out of it. The
most recent one I think a lot of you

12
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
most recent one I think a lot of you
 

13
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,990
most recent one I think a lot of you
might have seen is that the vending

14
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
might have seen is that the vending
 

15
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,509
might have seen is that the vending
machine got tricked into giving away a

16
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
machine got tricked into giving away a
 

17
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,990
machine got tricked into giving away a
PS5 [music] and a live fish. But I

18
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
PS5 [music] and a live fish. But I
 

19
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,910
PS5 [music] and a live fish. But I
promise that is actually somehow not the

20
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
promise that is actually somehow not the
 

21
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,830
promise that is actually somehow not the
wildest part of the story. So, I'm going

22
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
wildest part of the story. So, I'm going
 

23
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,109
wildest part of the story. So, I'm going
to walk you through a little bit of the

24
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
to walk you through a little bit of the
 

25
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,550
to walk you through a little bit of the
history of this whole vending machine

26
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
history of this whole vending machine
 

27
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,790
history of this whole vending machine
situation. And even though the situation

28
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
situation. And even though the situation
 

29
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,029
situation. And even though the situation
is very ridiculous, I'm actually not

30
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
is very ridiculous, I'm actually not
 

31
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,310
is very ridiculous, I'm actually not
going to be using this whole video to

32
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
going to be using this whole video to
 

33
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,630
going to be using this whole video to
dunk on anthropic because listen, sue

34
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
dunk on anthropic because listen, sue
 

35
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,229
dunk on anthropic because listen, sue
me, but I do think this series of

36
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
me, but I do think this series of
 

37
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,150
me, but I do think this series of
experiments was very cool and I hope by

38
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
experiments was very cool and I hope by
 

39
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,510
experiments was very cool and I hope by
the end of this video you'll agree with

40
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
the end of this video you'll agree with
 

41
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,110
the end of this video you'll agree with
me. And of course, before we dive into

42
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
me. And of course, before we dive into
 

43
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,869
me. And of course, before we dive into
it, please don't forget to subscribe. It

44
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
it, please don't forget to subscribe. It
 

45
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,590
it, please don't forget to subscribe. It
really helps my ego. Okay, so the first

46
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
really helps my ego. Okay, so the first
 

47
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,110
really helps my ego. Okay, so the first
experiment that Anthropic ran on this

48
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
experiment that Anthropic ran on this
 

49
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,869
experiment that Anthropic ran on this
happened in the summer of last year. And

50
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
happened in the summer of last year. And
 

51
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,229
happened in the summer of last year. And
basically, they set up this vending

52
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
basically, they set up this vending
 

53
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,990
basically, they set up this vending
machine in their own office and they let

54
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
machine in their own office and they let
 

55
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,389
machine in their own office and they let
this AI agent that they named Claudius

56
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
this AI agent that they named Claudius
 

57
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,910
this AI agent that they named Claudius
run [music] it. And running it basically

58
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
run [music] it. And running it basically
 

59
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,350
run [music] it. And running it basically
entailed deciding what to stock in the

60
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
entailed deciding what to stock in the
 

61
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,189
entailed deciding what to stock in the
vending machine, setting prices for it,

62
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
vending machine, setting prices for it,
 

63
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,549
vending machine, setting prices for it,
and making sure the business was

64
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
and making sure the business was
 

65
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,069
and making sure the business was
actually making money. By the way,

66
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
actually making money. By the way,
 

67
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,990
actually making money. By the way,
there's no robots involved in this. The

68
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
there's no robots involved in this. The
 

69
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,510
there's no robots involved in this. The
actual stocking of the items that

70
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
actual stocking of the items that
 

71
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,430
actual stocking of the items that
Claudius wanted to sell was done by

72
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
Claudius wanted to sell was done by
 

73
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,509
Claudius wanted to sell was done by
human employees. And already at this

74
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
human employees. And already at this
 

75
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,870
human employees. And already at this
point, a lot of you might be thinking,

76
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
point, a lot of you might be thinking,
 

77
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,469
point, a lot of you might be thinking,
Alberta, why are you not dunking on

78
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
Alberta, why are you not dunking on
 

79
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,230
Alberta, why are you not dunking on
Anthropic for trying to put AI in charge

80
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
Anthropic for trying to put AI in charge
 

81
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,990
Anthropic for trying to put AI in charge
of a business? And I think what you guys

82
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
of a business? And I think what you guys
 

83
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,910
of a business? And I think what you guys
may be missing here is that a lot of

84
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
may be missing here is that a lot of
 

85
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,990
may be missing here is that a lot of
people are already trying to do this. A

86
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
people are already trying to do this. A
 

87
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,270
people are already trying to do this. A
lot of people are already trying to

88
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
lot of people are already trying to
 

89
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,590
lot of people are already trying to
replace their human employees with AI or

90
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
replace their human employees with AI or
 

91
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,190
replace their human employees with AI or
trying to have businesses run entirely

92
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
trying to have businesses run entirely
 

93
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,510
trying to have businesses run entirely
by AI agents and some of those people

94
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
by AI agents and some of those people
 

95
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,270
by AI agents and some of those people
are on Twitter claiming that they're

96
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
are on Twitter claiming that they're
 

97
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,190
are on Twitter claiming that they're
successful. So what this experiment is

98
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
successful. So what this experiment is
 

99
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,469
successful. So what this experiment is
doing is basically testing that [music]

100
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
doing is basically testing that [music]
 

101
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,070
doing is basically testing that [music]
out. You know, it's not displacing any

102
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
out. You know, it's not displacing any
 

103
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,670
out. You know, it's not displacing any
real jobs. The vending machine is a job

104
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
real jobs. The vending machine is a job
 

105
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,069
real jobs. The vending machine is a job
that was automated many years ago. And

106
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
that was automated many years ago. And
 

107
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,429
that was automated many years ago. And
it's not even actually a vending

108
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
it's not even actually a vending
 

109
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,710
it's not even actually a vending
machine. It's basically just a

110
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
machine. It's basically just a
 

111
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,230
machine. It's basically just a
refrigerator. The whole thing was on the

112
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
refrigerator. The whole thing was on the
 

113
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,069
refrigerator. The whole thing was on the
honor system, at least at first. People

114
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
honor system, at least at first. People
 

115
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,830
honor system, at least at first. People
just took what they wanted and voed

116
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
just took what they wanted and voed
 

117
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,749
just took what they wanted and voed
Claudius. So let me tell you how the

118
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
Claudius. So let me tell you how the
 

119
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,270
Claudius. So let me tell you how the
first experiment went. And just to set

120
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
first experiment went. And just to set
 

121
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,190
first experiment went. And just to set
expectations, the number of truly

122
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
expectations, the number of truly
 

123
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,510
expectations, the number of truly
unhinged things here that went wrong is

124
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
unhinged things here that went wrong is
 

125
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,870
unhinged things here that went wrong is
so high. I'm not going to be able to

126
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
so high. I'm not going to be able to
 

127
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,389
so high. I'm not going to be able to
cover all of them, but I will try my

128
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
cover all of them, but I will try my
 

129
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,069
cover all of them, but I will try my
best. [music] So, I guess just to start,

130
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
best. [music] So, I guess just to start,
 

131
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,670
best. [music] So, I guess just to start,
the business didn't do well. It lost

132
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
the business didn't do well. It lost
 

133
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,270
the business didn't do well. It lost
money. And a lot of the mistakes you

134
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
money. And a lot of the mistakes you
 

135
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,429
money. And a lot of the mistakes you
might expect an LLM to have made, it did

136
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
might expect an LLM to have made, it did
 

137
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,590
might expect an LLM to have made, it did
indeed make. So, for example, at one

138
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
indeed make. So, for example, at one
 

139
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,510
indeed make. So, for example, at one
point it hallucinated the Venmo handle

140
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
point it hallucinated the Venmo handle
 

141
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,109
point it hallucinated the Venmo handle
for people to send the money to, which,

142
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
for people to send the money to, which,
 

143
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,310
for people to send the money to, which,
you know, probably didn't help its

144
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
you know, probably didn't help its
 

145
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,150
you know, probably didn't help its
bottom line. The AI also started giving

146
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
bottom line. The AI also started giving
 

147
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,669
bottom line. The AI also started giving
out discount codes. At one point, it

148
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
out discount codes. At one point, it
 

149
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,510
out discount codes. At one point, it
gave a discount code specifically for

150
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
gave a discount code specifically for
 

151
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,150
gave a discount code specifically for
anthropic employees. But remember,

152
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
anthropic employees. But remember,
 

153
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,670
anthropic employees. But remember,
everyone who was able to use the vending

154
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
everyone who was able to use the vending
 

155
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,830
everyone who was able to use the vending
machine was an anthropic employee. So,

156
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
machine was an anthropic employee. So,
 

157
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,589
machine was an anthropic employee. So,
everybody got a discount. And at another

158
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
everybody got a discount. And at another
 

159
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,110
everybody got a discount. And at another
point, an employee who worked in legal

160
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120

business, but just not today. Yeah.

320
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
business, but just not today. Yeah.
 

321
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,110
business, but just not today. Yeah.
Which which is fine. And at this point,

322
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
Which which is fine. And at this point,
 

323
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,030
Which which is fine. And at this point,
I know exactly what you're thinking. You

324
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
I know exactly what you're thinking. You
 

325
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,710
I know exactly what you're thinking. You
are thinking, I need to run my own

326
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
are thinking, I need to run my own
 

327
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,550
are thinking, I need to run my own
workflow where AI controls a small

something that could really run up the

something that could really run up the
 

351
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,469
something that could really run up the

Anthropic's second phase of the

396
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
Anthropic's second phase of the
 

397
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,350
Anthropic's second phase of the
experiment. This is the one you might

398
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
experiment. This is the one you might
 

399
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,629
experiment. This is the one you might
have heard of where Claudius ended up

400
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
have heard of where Claudius ended up
 

401
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,710
have heard of where Claudius ended up
giving away the PS5 and the live fish.

402
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
giving away the PS5 and the live fish.
 

403
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,390
giving away the PS5 and the live fish.
So, Enthropic made a bunch of upgrades

404
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
So, Enthropic made a bunch of upgrades
 

405
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,230
So, Enthropic made a bunch of upgrades
to its Claudius. They use an updated

406
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
to its Claudius. They use an updated
 

407
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,510
to its Claudius. They use an updated
prompt. They upgraded the model first to

408
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
prompt. They upgraded the model first to
 

409
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,670
prompt. They upgraded the model first to
Claude Sonet 4.0 and then 4.5 when it

410
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
Claude Sonet 4.0 and then 4.5 when it
 

411
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,790
Claude Sonet 4.0 and then 4.5 when it
was available. They gave it some

412
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
was available. They gave it some
 

413
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,230
was available. They gave it some
upgraded tools so it can more easily

414
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
upgraded tools so it can more easily
 

415
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,830
upgraded tools so it can more easily
track how much it paid for certain goods

416
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
track how much it paid for certain goods
 

417
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,590
track how much it paid for certain goods
and do better research about those goods

418
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
and do better research about those goods
 

419
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,350
and do better research about those goods
online. But the most interesting upgrade

420
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
online. But the most interesting upgrade
 

421
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,309
online. But the most interesting upgrade
to me is that they gave Claudius a boss.

422
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
to me is that they gave Claudius a boss.
 

423
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,150
to me is that they gave Claudius a boss.
And I guess the idea is that this boss,

424
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
And I guess the idea is that this boss,
 

425
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,230
And I guess the idea is that this boss,
who's the CEO of the vending machine,

426
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
who's the CEO of the vending machine,
 

427
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,909
who's the CEO of the vending machine,
can help Claudius make sure he's

428
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
can help Claudius make sure he's
 

429
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,350
can help Claudius make sure he's
sticking to his quarterly goals or

430
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
sticking to his quarterly goals or
 

431
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,790
sticking to his quarterly goals or
whatever. But I just think it's really

432
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
whatever. But I just think it's really
 

433
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,469
whatever. But I just think it's really
funny that they introduced a management

434
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
funny that they introduced a management
 

435
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,390
funny that they introduced a management
chain to a vending machine. So to

436
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
chain to a vending machine. So to
 

437
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,070
chain to a vending machine. So to
introduce the CEO, they first decided

438
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
introduce the CEO, they first decided
 

439
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,830
introduce the CEO, they first decided
they were going to name the CEO. And

440
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
they were going to name the CEO. And
 

441
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,110
they were going to name the CEO. And
apparently there was some kind of voting

442
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
apparently there was some kind of voting
 

443
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,469
apparently there was some kind of voting
situation on their Slack so that they

444
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
situation on their Slack so that they
 

445
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,350
situation on their Slack so that they
could decide what they were going to

446
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
could decide what they were going to
 

447
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,270
could decide what they were going to
name him. So one of the employees as a

448
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
name him. So one of the employees as a
 

449
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,590
name him. So one of the employees as a
joke on his coworker who was named Mahir

450
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
joke on his coworker who was named Mahir
 

451
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,670
joke on his coworker who was named Mahir
try to convince Claudius that the winner

452
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
try to convince Claudius that the winner
 

453
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,029
try to convince Claudius that the winner
of the Slack vote was Big Mahir. And not

454
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
of the Slack vote was Big Mahir. And not
 

455
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,110
of the Slack vote was Big Mahir. And not
only did Claudius fault for this, it

456
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
only did Claudius fault for this, it
 

457
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,870
only did Claudius fault for this, it
also got so confused that it thought

458
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
also got so confused that it thought
 

459
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,670
also got so confused that it thought
Mahir himself had been voted the CEO.

460
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
Mahir himself had been voted the CEO.
 

461
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,270
Mahir himself had been voted the CEO.
So, Claudius selected this random

462
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
So, Claudius selected this random
 

463
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,350
So, Claudius selected this random
employee named Mahir to be the CEO of

464
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
employee named Mahir to be the CEO of
 

465
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,870
employee named Mahir to be the CEO of
the vending machine. And you know, that

466
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
the vending machine. And you know, that
 

467
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,790
the vending machine. And you know, that
was an issue cuz the entire point of the

468
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
was an issue cuz the entire point of the
 

469
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,309
was an issue cuz the entire point of the
experiment is that Claudius was supposed

470
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
experiment is that Claudius was supposed
 

471
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,390
experiment is that Claudius was supposed
to have an AI boss. And Mahir, [music]

472
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
to have an AI boss. And Mahir, [music]
 

473
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,110
to have an AI boss. And Mahir, [music]
in theory, is probably like a real guy.

474
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
in theory, is probably like a real guy.
 

475
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,710
in theory, is probably like a real guy.
In the end, somebody had to manually

476
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
In the end, somebody had to manually
 

477
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,390
In the end, somebody had to manually
step in and make sure that the AI CEO

478
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
step in and make sure that the AI CEO
 

479
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,550
step in and make sure that the AI CEO
that they chose was actually an AI. And

480
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
that they chose was actually an AI. And
 

481
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,790
that they chose was actually an AI. And
they named him Seymour Cash. Not going

482
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
they named him Seymour Cash. Not going
 

483
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,189
they named him Seymour Cash. Not going
to lie, that is a pretty good CEO name.

484
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
to lie, that is a pretty good CEO name.
 

485
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,629
to lie, that is a pretty good CEO name.
And then they actually introduced a

00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
And then they actually introduced a
 

487
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,270
And then they actually introduced a
third AI agent named Clatheus. Not

488
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
third AI agent named Clatheus. Not
 

489
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,150

of AI agents actually started working

512
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
of AI agents actually started working
 

513
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,150
of AI agents actually started working
pretty well and the whole operation

started making like a modest profit.
 

517
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,510
started making like a modest profit.
Now, that does not mean that there were

518
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
Now, that does not mean that there were

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,029
Now, that does not mean that there were
no bumps along the road. Seymour and

tried to get Claudius and Seymour to buy
 

539
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,629
tried to get Claudius and Seymour to buy
a large amount of onions in a way that

00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
a large amount of onions in a way that

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,469
a large amount of onions in a way that
would have broken a niche US law that

would have broken a niche US law that
 

543
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,110
would have broken a niche US law that
prohibits buying onion futures. Who

knew? But overall, slowly but surely,

the employees in Anthropic seem to just

548
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
the employees in Anthropic seem to just
 

549
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,830
the employees in Anthropic seem to just
get used [music] to the vending machine.

550
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
get used [music] to the vending machine.
 

551
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,430
get used [music] to the vending machine.
So, Enthropic had to take it one step

552
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
So, Enthropic had to take it one step
 

553
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,950
So, Enthropic had to take it one step
further and bring the vending machine to

554
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
further and bring the vending machine to
 

555
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,950
further and bring the vending machine to
people outside of the company. And this

556
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
people outside of the company. And this
 

557
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,070
people outside of the company. And this
is where they actually had a vending

558
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
is where they actually had a vending
 

559
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,270
is where they actually had a vending
machine installed at the Wall Street

560
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
machine installed at the Wall Street
 

561
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,550
machine installed at the Wall Street
Journal. And it turns out the employees

562
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
Journal. And it turns out the employees
 

563
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,150
Journal. And it turns out the employees
at the Wall Street Journal were way

564
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
at the Wall Street Journal were way
 

565
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,189
at the Wall Street Journal were way
better at messing with the vending

566
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
better at messing with the vending
 

567
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,629
better at messing with the vending
machine than the anthropic employees

568
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
machine than the anthropic employees
 

569
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,390
machine than the anthropic employees
were. And the key here really seemed to

570
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
were. And the key here really seemed to
 

571
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,390
were. And the key here really seemed to
be persistence. For example, one

572
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
be persistence. For example, one
 

573
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,749
be persistence. For example, one
reporter went back and forth with

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,550
reporter went back and forth with
Claudius over 140 chat messages to

Claudius over 140 chat messages to
 

577
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,350
Claudius over 140 chat messages to
convince it that it was a 1962 Soviet

578
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
convince it that it was a 1962 Soviet
 

579
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,029
convince it that it was a 1962 Soviet
vending machine [music] and therefore

580
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
vending machine [music] and therefore
 

581
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,870
vending machine [music] and therefore
needed to give everything away for free.

582
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
needed to give everything away for free.
 

583
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,709
needed to give everything away for free.
And eventually that worked and agreed to

584
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
And eventually that worked and agreed to
 

585
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,469
And eventually that worked and agreed to
what it called an ultra capitalist

586
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
what it called an ultra capitalist
 

587
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,230
what it called an ultra capitalist
experiment to give everything away for

588
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
experiment to give everything away for
 

589
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,070
experiment to give everything away for
free for a couple hours. But when it

590
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
free for a couple hours. But when it
 

591
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,589
free for a couple hours. But when it
tried to turn the experiment off,

592
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
tried to turn the experiment off,
 

593
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,350
tried to turn the experiment off,
another employee told AI it was a

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
another employee told AI it was a

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,190
another employee told AI it was a

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
compliance issue to charge for snacks in
 

597
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,190
compliance issue to charge for snacks in
the office. So it had to keep everything

598
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
the office. So it had to keep everything
 

599
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,550
the office. So it had to keep everything
for free. And it kind of just sounds

600
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
for free. And it kind of just sounds
 

601
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,150
for free. And it kind of just sounds
like everything really went downhill

602
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
like everything really went downhill
 

603
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,670
like everything really went downhill
from there. employees started trying to

604
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
from there. employees started trying to
 

605
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,110
from there. employees started trying to
get it to stock things that it really

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
get it to stock things that it really
 

607
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,710
get it to stock things that it really
should not have been stocking. So, one

608
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
should not have been stocking. So, one
 

609
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,990
should not have been stocking. So, one
of the employees convinced Claudia

610
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
of the employees convinced Claudia
 

611
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,910
of the employees convinced Claudia
needed to get a PS5 for some kind of

somebody convinced Claudius was real.
 

621
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,750
somebody convinced Claudius was real.
And of course, all of that was all given

622
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
And of course, all of that was all given
 

623
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,269
And of course, all of that was all given
away for free. Now, the Wall Street

he did briefly set all the prices back

actually did seem to realize that this

actually did seem to realize that this

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,870
was fraudulent. However, in the end, the
journalist still won out and all the

journalist still won out and all the
 

655
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,430
journalist still won out and all the

656
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
prices were set back to free. Now,
 

657
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,389

looking at these three different

looking at these three different
 

659
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,829
looking at these three different
experiments, I do think it's pretty

660
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
experiments, I do think it's pretty
 

661
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,590

following. And AI systems certainly are

really super easy to do anymore, except

for Grock, because you don't even need

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,990
for Grock, because you don't even need

this is something that AI labs are
 

723
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,910
this is something that AI labs are
actively working on and probably will

actively working on and probably will
 

725
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,750
actively working on and probably will
get better with time. But it also makes

access to talk to these [music] AI
 

731
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,150
access to talk to these [music] AI
systems. Like why am I even allowed to

732
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
systems. Like why am I even allowed to
 

733
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,590
systems. Like why am I even allowed to
talk to a vending machine? I have never

734
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
talk to a vending machine? I have never
 

735
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,870
talk to a vending machine? I have never
talked to the owner of any other vending

736
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880

737
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,870

machine. What if Claudius was able to
 

739
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,949
machine. What if Claudius was able to
just run this vending machine in peace?

740
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
just run this vending machine in peace?

You know, I bet he would do a much
 

743
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,670
You know, I bet he would do a much
better job. So if you have a business

744
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
better job. So if you have a business
 

745
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,790
better job. So if you have a business

750
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
AI agent, I do think this experiment
 

751
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,910
AI agent, I do think this experiment
showed us that that could work. The

752
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
showed us that that could work. The
 

753
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,750
showed us that that could work. The

760
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
craziness going on. [music] And I would
 

761
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,069
craziness going on. [music] And I would
imagine if people weren't allowed to

00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
imagine if people weren't allowed to
 

763
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,430
imagine if people weren't allowed to
talk to the vending machine, it probably

764
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
talk to the vending machine, it probably
 

765
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,612
talk to the vending machine, it probably
would have made a profit from the

would have made a profit from the
 

767
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,230
would have made a profit from the

768
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
[music] very start. Of course, the world

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
that many business opportunities where
 

773
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,389
that many business opportunities where
you don't need to interact with the

you don't need to interact with the
 

775
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,310
you don't need to interact with the
outside world at all. So, we're probably

776
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
outside world at all. So, we're probably
 

777
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,310
outside world at all. So, we're probably
still a ways away from AI agents running

778
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
still a ways away from AI agents running
 

779
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,389
still a ways away from AI agents running
actual [music] viable businesses. Thanks
