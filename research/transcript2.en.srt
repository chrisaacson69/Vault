957
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,309
capable model overall. So, I get the
skepticism. I also get that people are

958

skepticism. I also get that people are
 

959

every couple of months. It is exhausting

962
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
every couple of months. It is exhausting
 

963
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,069
every couple of months. It is exhausting
to keep up with. But that doesn't mean

964

965
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,990
to keep up with. But that doesn't mean
it's not real. And that is part of why

966
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
it's not real. And that is part of why

And we don't know where this stops. We

And we don't know where this stops. We
 

1615

And we don't know where this stops. We
just know it's going faster. That's the

fact is the agents are here, they work,

fact is the agents are here, they work,
 

1623

fact is the agents are here, they work,
and it's just getting faster from here.
