## Branches

- [Morality](./morality/README.md) — what is good, what is right, and why
- [Logic and Mathematics](./logic-and-math/README.md) — structural realism; formalisms as maps, not territory
- [Epistemology](./epistemology/README.md) — (stub) how we know what we know; Objectivist engagement; non-human cognition
- [Legal Theory](./legal-theory/README.md) — applied libertarian legal philosophy; NAP, property rights, adversarial debates
- [Measurement, Causality, and Free Will](./measurement-causality.md) — measurement as the basis of causality; consciousness as simulation; physical grounding of free will
- [Civilizational Cycles](./civilizational-cycles.md) — theories of rise and fall; Ibn Khaldun, Spengler, Toynbee, Turchin, Tainter, Hayek, and their connections to economics and the voluntary-to-coercion drift

## Notes

Philosophy here follows the same approach as the economics research: build from bedrock concepts upward, test against real cases, and connect back to the practical questions (AI alignment, agent design, human/AI collaboration).
