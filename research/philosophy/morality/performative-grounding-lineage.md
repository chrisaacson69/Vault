## Overview

Chris's "performative grounding" argument (formulated 2026-02-28 in the [morality framework](./README.md#the-resolution-performative-grounding-2026-02-28)) claims:

1. The actor who asks "why should I value X?" is *already acting*, which presupposes valuation.
2. This is a **performative contradiction** — the act of questioning refutes the content of the question.
3. This escapes Agrippa's trilemma because it is not an axiom asserted without defense, not circular, and not an infinite regress. It is grounded in the *fact of acting*, which is prior to argumentation.

This argument has a deep and contested philosophical lineage. What follows is a survey of every major thinker who has made the same or a structurally similar move, what they derived from it, what objections they faced, and what Chris's formulation can learn from them.

## 1. Aristotle — Retortion and the Defense of Non-Contradiction

### Core Argument

In *Metaphysics* Gamma 3-4, Aristotle defends the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC) using what later philosophers call **retortion** (*peritropē* — "turning the tables"). Since LNC is the most fundamental principle of thought, it cannot be proved directly without begging the question. Instead, Aristotle shows that anyone who *denies* LNC must presuppose it in order to mean anything definite by their denial. The denier's performance (making a meaningful assertion) contradicts the content of their assertion (that meaningful assertion is impossible without LNC).

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Aristotle's move is structural, not directly ethical. But it establishes the template: some propositions cannot be denied without the denial being self-undermining. The question is whether this template extends from logic to ethics — from "you must presuppose non-contradiction to think" to "you must presuppose valuation to act."

### Relation to Agrippa's Trilemma

Aristotle does not frame it this way (Agrippa came later), but his defense of LNC is explicitly a response to the impossibility of direct proof for first principles. His solution: you do not *prove* LNC; you show that denying it is incoherent. This is the prototype for the "fourth option" beyond dogmatism, regress, and circularity.

### Key Works

- **Aristotle, *Metaphysics*, Book Gamma (IV), chapters 3-4** (c. 350 BCE)
- **Luca Castagnoli, *Ancient Self-Refutation: The Logic and History of the Self-Refutation Argument from Democritus to Augustine*** (Cambridge University Press, 2010) — the definitive scholarly treatment. Traces the *peritropē* from Democritus through Plato (*Theaetetus*), Aristotle, Hellenistic philosophy, and Augustine.

### Major Objections

- **Ontological vs. transcendental:** Does retortion show that LNC is true of *reality*, or only that it is a precondition of *thought*? If only the latter, the move grounds how we must think, not how things are.
- **The Protagorean escape:** A relativist can say "LNC is true *for you* but not for me." Aristotle addresses this but the response is disputed.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** The structural template holds. The key question is whether the extension from logic to ethics is valid — whether "you must presuppose valuation to act" is as tight as "you must presuppose non-contradiction to think."

## 2. Karl-Otto Apel — Transcendental Pragmatics and *Letztbegründung*

### Core Argument

Apel (1922-2017) developed **transcendental pragmatics** as an extension of Kant: the conditions for valid knowledge cannot be found in individual consciousness but only in the pragmatic presuppositions of language and argumentation. Anyone who argues *at all* is already committed to certain norms — truthfulness, sincerity, equal participation, openness to the force of the better argument. To deny these norms *while arguing* is a **performative self-contradiction** (*performativer Selbstwiderspruch*).

Apel went further than anyone else in claiming this constitutes **ultimate justification** (*Letztbegründung*) — a definitive grounding of ethics that escapes the Münchhausen trilemma (the German name for Agrippa's trilemma, coined by Hans Albert in 1968).

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Apel's move is the closest predecessor to Chris's performative grounding. He claims to derive normative content (ethical obligations) directly from the unavoidable presuppositions of argumentation. There is moral content "always already recognized since it is implicit in argumentation and irrefutable on pain of performative self-contradiction." The is-ought gap is bridged because the "is" of argumentation already contains the "ought" of its normative presuppositions.

### Relation to Agrippa's Trilemma

**This is the philosopher who most explicitly frames performative contradiction as a fourth option beyond Agrippa's trilemma.** Apel argued that the trilemma only holds if justification is restricted to deriving propositions from propositions. Once you move to the pragmatic level — the level of what is presupposed by the *act* of arguing — you find propositions that cannot be denied without self-contradiction, yet are not axioms, not circular, and do not generate infinite regress. The trilemma commits what Apel called an **"abstractive fallacy"**: it abstracts away the arguing subject.

Vittorio Hösle sharpened this: the Münchhausen trilemma itself claims "it is ultimately justified that there is no ultimate justification" — which is self-contradictory by its own standards.

### Key Works

- **Karl-Otto Apel, *Transformation der Philosophie*, 2 vols.** (Suhrkamp, 1973). English selection: *Towards a Transformation of Philosophy* (Marquette University Press, 1998). The foundational work. Volume II contains the crucial essay on the "a priori of the communication community."
- **Karl-Otto Apel, *Diskurs und Verantwortung: Das Problem des Übergangs zur postkonventionellen Moral*** (Suhrkamp, 1988). Develops discourse ethics and the two-level architecture (ideal principles + real-world responsibility).
- **Karl-Otto Apel, *Auseinandersetzungen in Erprobung des transzendentalpragmatischen Ansatzes*** (Suhrkamp, 1998). Three extended discussions of differences with Habermas.
- **Eduardo Mendieta, *The Adventures of Transcendental Philosophy: Karl-Otto Apel's Semiotics and Discourse Ethics*** (Rowman & Littlefield, 2002). Best English-language secondary source.

### Major Objections

- **"Too thin" objection:** The norms derivable from argumentation are extremely minimal — truthfulness, sincerity, equal access. Can they ground substantive ethics? Apel acknowledged this and supplemented them with a "principle of responsibility," but critics argue the supplement is not derivable from the transcendental argument itself.
- **Habermas's retreat:** Habermas, Apel's closest collaborator, ultimately denied that performative contradiction provides *justification* of norms. He held it only *identifies* unavoidable rules of discourse — a heuristic, not a foundation. This is a significant defection from the strongest version of the argument.
- **Critical rationalist objection (Hans Albert):** Albert insisted the trilemma applies to all justifications, including transcendental ones. Apel's "fourth way" is just disguised dogmatism (accepting as foundational something that merely seems undeniable). The debate between Albert and Apel ran for decades without resolution.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** Apel's version grounds norms of *argumentation*, not norms of *action in general*. Chris's move is broader — grounding valuation in the fact of acting, not just the fact of arguing. This avoids the objection that argumentation norms only bind during arguments, but faces the challenge of showing that *all* action (not just argumentation) carries normative presuppositions.

---

## 3. Jürgen Habermas — Discourse Ethics and the Moderated Version

### Core Argument

Habermas (b. 1929) co-developed discourse ethics with Apel but took a more modest position. His two principles:

- **Principle (D):** "Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse."
- **Principle (U):** A universalizability test for norms, analogous to Kant's categorical imperative but dialogical rather than monological.

Habermas uses performative contradiction to *identify* the rules of discourse (e.g., anyone who argues presupposes sincerity, equal access, freedom from coercion) but denies this amounts to *justifying* those rules or any substantive moral norms.

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Habermas's position is deliberately weaker than Apel's. He aims to show that our basic moral intuitions spring from normative presuppositions of social interaction that belong to the repertoire of competent agents in any society — but he frames this as reconstruction of existing moral competence, not as derivation of morality from scratch. The is-ought gap is narrowed but not claimed to be closed.

### Key Works

- **Jürgen Habermas, *Moralbewusstsein und kommunikatives Handeln*** (Suhrkamp, 1983). English: *Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action* (MIT Press, 1990). Contains the first systematic statement of discourse ethics.
- **Jürgen Habermas, *Erläuterungen zur Diskursethik*** (Suhrkamp, 1991). English: *Justification and Application: Remarks on Discourse Ethics* (MIT Press, 1993). Clarifications and revisions.

- **Jürgen Habermas, *Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns*, 2 vols.** (Suhrkamp, 1981). English: *The Theory of Communicative Action* (Beacon Press, 1984/1987). The larger framework within which discourse ethics sits.

### Major Objections

- **Same "too thin" problem as Apel**, compounded by Habermas's own retreat from *Letztbegründung*.
- **The circularity worry:** Habermas admits that demonstrating performative contradictions only identifies rules, not justifies them. But then what *does* justify them? This leaves a justificatory gap.
- **Schnädelbach's critique:** Rational reconstruction of communication as discourse may not provide the *substantive moral reasons* that critical theory requires — only an *account* of those reasons.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** Habermas's modesty is actually instructive. Chris should consider whether his performative grounding is doing the Apel move (claiming full justification) or the Habermas move (identifying unavoidable presuppositions without claiming they constitute proof). The morality README leans Apel-ward. The Habermas critique suggests testing whether that stronger claim is defensible.

## 4. Hans-Hermann Hoppe — Argumentation Ethics (Libertarian Application)

### Core Argument

Hoppe (b. 1949) took the Apel/Habermas framework and applied it to libertarian political philosophy. His claim: anyone who engages in argumentation has already presupposed **self-ownership** and **Lockean homesteading** (first use = ownership). To argue against these principles while arguing is a performative contradiction, because argumentation requires exclusive control over one's own body and previously acquired resources. Therefore, only the non-aggression principle can be justified without performative contradiction.

First published in three articles in 1988, then systematized in Chapter 7 of *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism* (1989).

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Hoppe explicitly claims to sidestep the is-ought problem. His argument "remains entirely in the realm of is-statements": (a) justification is propositional — a priori true; (b) argumentation presupposes property in one's body — a priori true; (c) no deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified — a priori true. Murray Rothbard praised this as transcending the is-ought dichotomy.

### Key Works

- **Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism: Economics, Politics, and Ethics*** (Kluwer Academic, 1989), Chapter 7: "The Ethical Justification of Capitalism and Why Socialism Is Morally Indefensible."
- **Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *The Economics and Ethics of Private Property: Studies in Political Economy and Philosophy*** (Kluwer Academic, 1993; 2nd ed. Mises Institute, 2006), Chapters 8-10.
- **Hans-Hermann Hoppe, "On the Ultimate Justification of the Ethics of Private Property,"** *Liberty* (September 1988). The original statement.
- **Stephan Kinsella, "Defending Argumentation Ethics"** — a sympathetic restatement addressing major objections.

### Major Objections

- **Liberty right vs. claim right (the fatal objection):** To avoid performative contradiction, one only needs a *liberty right* (permission) to make propositions — not a *claim right* (which entails duties from others). Libertarian self-ownership consists of claim rights. Hoppe's argument conflates the two. This is arguably devastating.
- **Scope limitation (Murphy & Callahan):** Even if the argument works, it only establishes rights to body parts necessary for argumentation, only during the debate, and not for third parties (babies, comatose patients, etc.).
- **Control ≠ ownership:** Having de facto control over one's body during argument does not establish that anyone *ought* to refrain from interfering with that control. This is an is-ought gap *within* the argument that claims to escape the is-ought gap.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** Hoppe's version is a cautionary tale about **over-deriving** from the performative contradiction. Chris's version is more modest — it grounds core convergent norms (don't murder, don't steal, don't betray) rather than a full libertarian political philosophy. The liberty/claim right distinction and the scope limitation are less damaging to the more modest version, but Chris should be aware of the slippery slope from "the asker demonstrates valuation" to "therefore specific political institutions are justified."

## 5. Alan Gewirth — The Principle of Generic Consistency

### Core Argument

Gewirth (1912-2004) argued that any agent, by the mere fact of acting, is logically committed to claiming rights to the generic conditions of action — **freedom** and **well-being**. The argument proceeds through his **"dialectically necessary method"**:

1. "I do X for purpose E" — every agent implicitly accepts this by acting.
2. I must regard E as good (or I wouldn't act).
3. I must regard the conditions for achieving E (freedom, well-being) as good.
4. I must claim a right to those conditions (since I must regard them as necessary goods).
5. By consistency, I must acknowledge that all other agents have the same right-claims for the same reasons.

**Conclusion:** The **Principle of Generic Consistency (PGC)**: "Act in accord with the generic rights of your recipients as well as of yourself."

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Gewirth's "dialectically necessary" method is explicitly designed to navigate the is-ought gap. Each step is a description of what an agent *must think* (dialectical), not a claim about the world (assertoric). The "ought" emerges not from facts about the world but from the internal logic of agency itself — denying the PGC while acting as an agent is a self-contradiction.

W.D. Hudson and R.M. Hare challenged whether Gewirth successfully bridges the gap. Gewirth responded that the PGC need not be established "assertorically" — establishing it dialectically (as something any agent must accept on pain of self-contradiction) is sufficient.

### Relation to Agrippa's Trilemma

The dialectically necessary method is transcendental in structure: it identifies what an agent *must presuppose* in order to act. Like Apel's Letztbegründung, it claims to escape the trilemma by grounding norms in the unavoidable structure of agency rather than in propositions derived from propositions.

### Key Works

- **Alan Gewirth, *Human Rights: Essays on Justification and Applications*** (University of Chicago Press, 1982).
- **Alan Gewirth, *The Community of Rights*** (University of Chicago Press, 1996).
- **Alan Gewirth, *Self-Fulfillment*** (Princeton University Press, 1998).

- **Edward Regis Jr. (ed.), *Gewirth's Ethical Rationalism: Critical Essays with a Reply by Alan Gewirth*** (University of Chicago Press, 1984). Contains major objections by Hare, Hudson, and others.

### Major Objections

- **The universalization step is contested:** Critics (including Alasdair MacIntyre) argue that an agent can consistently claim rights for themselves without extending them to all other agents. The move from "I need freedom and well-being" to "all agents have a right to freedom and well-being" may not be logically compelled.
- **Dialectical vs. assertoric gap:** Even if agents *must accept* the PGC from their own standpoint, this may not establish that the PGC is objectively true or that it constitutes moral knowledge.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** Gewirth's argument is the closest in *structure* to Chris's, but more ambitious. Chris derives "you must presuppose valuation" from acting; Gewirth derives a full system of rights from acting. The universalization step — getting from "I value" to "all agents have rights" — is where Gewirth faces his strongest objections, and Chris should carefully consider whether his own argument requires that step or can remain at the more modest level of "convergent norms are performatively grounded."

## 6. Christine Korsgaard — Sources of Normativity and Self-Constitution

### Core Argument

Korsgaard (b. 1952) develops a Kantian constitutivism: rational beings constitute themselves as agents by choosing actions in accordance with practical reason. Her transcendental argument: "Since you cannot act without reasons and your humanity is the source of your reasons, you must value your own humanity if you are to act at all." Humanity (understood as rational agency) is the condition for the possibility of all value — and therefore has unconditional value.

She extends this to others through the **publicity of reasons** (drawing on Wittgenstein): reasons are inherently public. My humanity can only provide me with reasons if humanity *as such* provides reasons. Therefore, the humanity of others also provides me with reasons and is the source of moral obligation.

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Korsgaard's constitutivism makes the "ought" internal to the activity it governs, not derived from external facts. Practical principles are **constitutive standards** — they define what it is to be an agent, the way the rules of chess define what it is to play chess. You cannot coherently be an agent while violating these standards, just as you cannot coherently play chess while ignoring the rules. The is-ought gap is dissolved because the normative is built into the structure of agency itself.

### Key Works

- **Christine Korsgaard, *The Sources of Normativity*** (Cambridge University Press, 1996). The foundational statement. Includes commentary by G.A. Cohen, Raymond Geuss, Thomas Nagel, and Bernard Williams, plus Korsgaard's reply.
- **Christine Korsgaard, *The Constitution of Agency: Essays on Practical Reason and Moral Psychology*** (Oxford University Press, 2008). Bridge between *Sources* and *Self-Constitution*.
- **Christine Korsgaard, *Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity*** (Oxford University Press, 2009). The mature system. Argues that the categorical imperative is a constitutive standard of agency — violating it is a defective form of self-constitution, like building a house that can't provide shelter.

### Major Objections

- **The problem of bad action:** If morality is constitutive of agency, how can anyone act immorally? Korsgaard's answer — immoral action is "defective" agency, like a badly built house — strikes many as unsatisfying. A serial killer seems to be exercising agency quite effectively.
- **The publicity of reasons argument is contested:** Critics argue that the move from "I must value my own humanity" to "I must value everyone's humanity" is not logically compelled. The alternative "argument from the sufficiency of agency" may be more promising but also faces challenges.
- **Specificially Kantian rather than universal:** Some critics argue that constitutivism establishes Korsgaard's preferred Kantian morality rather than morality as such. The connection to the categorical imperative is not as tight as she claims.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** Korsgaard's constitutivism is perhaps the most sympathetic framework to Chris's performative grounding. Both identify the "ought" as already embedded in the structure of agency. Chris's version is less Kantian and more naturalistic — grounding convergent norms rather than the categorical imperative. Korsgaard's "publicity of reasons" argument is one way to handle the extension from "I must value" to "we all must value," though it has been criticized.

## 7. Ludwig Wittgenstein — Hinge Propositions (*On Certainty*)

### Core Argument

In *On Certainty* (published posthumously 1969), Wittgenstein argues that certain propositions function as **hinges** — they cannot be doubted or justified within our epistemic practices because they are the framework *within which* doubting and justifying take place. "If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put" (OC 341-343).

Hinge propositions are not themselves known or justified — they are the **ground** of our language-games, the background against which all distinctions between true and false are made. Wittgenstein argues: "it is our *acting* which lies at the bottom of the language-game" (OC 204).

### Relation to the Is-Ought Gap

Wittgenstein does not address the is-ought gap directly, but the structure of hinge epistemology is strikingly parallel to performative grounding:

- Certain commitments cannot be doubted without undermining the very practice of doubting.
- These commitments are *shown* in action, not stated as propositions.
- They are neither justified nor unjustified — they are the framework that makes justification possible.

Recent scholarship (notably the article "Wittgenstein, Ethics and Basic Moral Certainty" in *Inquiry*, 2008) extends hinge epistemology to ethics, arguing for "basic moral certainty" — moral commitments so fundamental that attempts to justify or doubt them betray a misunderstanding of their role. One scholar goes further, arguing that ethical normativity is the only kind of normativity capable of grounding the rationality of hinges themselves — reversing the direction of explanation.

### Key Works

- **Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Über Gewissheit / On Certainty*** (Blackwell, 1969). Posthumous, edited by G.E.M. Anscombe and G.H. von Wright.
- **Danièle Moyal-Sharrock, *Understanding Wittgenstein's On Certainty*** (Palgrave Macmillan, 2004). Key interpretive work.
- **Duncan Pritchard, *Epistemic Angst: Radical Skepticism and the Groundlessness of Our Believing*** (Princeton University Press, 2015). Develops the "hinge commitment" reading.
- **Annalisa Coliva, *Moore and Wittgenstein: Scepticism, Certainty and Common Sense*** (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).
- **Silvia Boncompagni, *Wittgenstein and Pragmatism*** (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016). Emphasizes the performative/praxis-oriented reading of hinges.
- **"Wittgenstein, Ethics and Basic Moral Certainty,"** *Inquiry* 51:3 (2008). Extends hinge epistemology to ethics.

### Major Objections

- **Hinges are descriptive, not normative:** Wittgenstein describes how our epistemic practices work, not how they *should* work. Extending this to ethics may conflate what we cannot help believing with what we are justified in believing.
- **Groundlessness cuts both ways:** If hinges are "groundless," this could support anti-realism as easily as it supports performative grounding. The framework is compatible with "we can't help acting as though values are real" without "values are real."
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** The connection is structural rather than direct. Chris's "performative grounding" and Wittgenstein's "hinges" share the insight that some commitments are shown in action rather than stated as propositions, and that doubting them undermines the practice of doubting itself. The Wittgensteinian framework provides additional vocabulary and arguments, but care is needed not to inherit Wittgenstein's anti-realist leanings if the goal is a realist grounding of morality.

## 8. Existentialist Connections: Heidegger and Sartre

### Heidegger: Thrownness (*Geworfenheit*)

Heidegger (1889-1976) argues in *Being and Time* (1927) that human existence (Dasein) is characterized by **thrownness** — we find ourselves "thrown" into a world we did not choose, already saddled with preferences, dispositions, and a cultural context. We are "never in control of our own being from the ground up." This condition generates an existential guilt — a "nullity of being-the-ground."

**Relation to performative grounding:** Thrownness captures the same structural point — the actor is *already in the game* before they can question the rules. You cannot step outside existence to evaluate it from a neutral standpoint. The question "should I exist?" is already asked from within existence.

**Key work:** Martin Heidegger, *Sein und Zeit* (*Being and Time*) (Max Niemeyer, 1927). English: trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (Harper & Row, 1962); trans. Joan Stambaugh (SUNY Press, 1996).

### Sartre: Condemned to Freedom

Sartre (1905-1980) radicalizes this: "Man is condemned to be free." Since "existence precedes essence," there is no fixed human nature determining what we ought to do. We are "alone, with no excuses" — responsible for everything we do despite not having created ourselves.

**Relation to performative grounding:** Sartre's position is *anti*-grounding in one sense (there are no given values) but *pro*-grounding in another (freedom and responsibility are inescapable). The act of denying responsibility is itself an exercise of the freedom that generates responsibility. This is a performative contradiction in the existentialist register.

**The crucial divergence:** Sartre's existentialism leads to a "moral wilderness" — the absence of any moral compass. Chris's performative grounding explicitly rejects this destination. For Sartre, the performative contradiction reveals freedom but not content; for Chris, it reveals that the actor *already values* continued existence and the conditions for it, which provides content.

**Key works:**
- **Jean-Paul Sartre, *L'Être et le Néant*** (*Being and Nothingness*) (Gallimard, 1943). English: trans. Hazel Barnes (Philosophical Library, 1956).
- **Jean-Paul Sartre, *L'existentialisme est un humanisme*** (*Existentialism is a Humanism*) (Nagel, 1946).

### Husserl's Performative Contradiction Charge

Husserl argued that to argue against *presence* (the evidential givenness of experience) is to enter into a performative contradiction — you undercut the evidence you present for your position. Heidegger and Sartre, by grounding constitution in pragmatic engagement and inner nothingness respectively, each face this charge in different ways.

**Key paper:** "Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre: Presence and the Performative Contradiction" (available on ResearchGate).

### Major Objections

- **Heidegger provides no ethics:** *Being and Time* is ontological, not ethical. Heidegger never derived moral content from thrownness. His later "Letter on Humanism" (1947) explicitly distances himself from Sartre's ethics.
- **Sartre's freedom is contentless:** It tells you that you must choose but not what to choose. This is precisely the gap Chris is trying to fill.
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** The existentialists provide the *existential situation* — you are thrown into existence and must act — but stop short of deriving normative content from it. Chris's move is to say that the existential situation *already contains* normative content (demonstrated by the actor's behavior). This is where Chris parts company with Sartre and aligns more with Apel and Gewirth.

---

## 9. John Finnis — New Natural Law and Self-Evidence

### Core Argument

Finnis (b. 1940) argues in *Natural Law and Natural Rights* (1980) that there are basic goods (life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, friendship, practical reasonableness, religion, marriage) that are **self-evident** — not provable from more fundamental premises, but undeniable in practice. Anyone who tries to deny that knowledge is a basic good must *engage in rational inquiry* to make the denial, thereby performatively contradicting themselves.

Finnis explicitly avoids the is-ought derivation: the basic goods are not deduced from facts about human nature but grasped immediately by practical reason. "Ought" does not follow from "is" because the first principles of practical reasoning are understood directly, not derived logically.

### Key Works

- **John Finnis, *Natural Law and Natural Rights*** (Oxford University Press, 1980; 2nd ed. 2011).
- **John Finnis, *Fundamentals of Ethics*** (Georgetown University Press, 1983).
- **Germain Grisez, "The First Principle of Practical Reason,"** *Natural Law Forum* 10 (1965). The foundational article for the new natural law theory.
- **John Finnis, "Scepticism's Self-Refutation,"** in *Reason in Action: Collected Essays Volume I* (Oxford University Press, 2011). Sets out the retorsive argument explicitly.

### Major Objections

- **Self-evidence is question-begging:** Calling the basic goods "self-evident" looks like the dogmatic horn of Agrippa's trilemma dressed up in new clothes. Why these goods and not others?
- **No hierarchy among basic goods:** Without a hierarchy, moral actors must choose between incommensurable goods without any principle to guide the choice (Hittinger's critique).
- **Applicability to Chris's formulation:** Finnis's retorsive argument about knowledge is the closest in spirit to Chris's performative grounding. The structural parallel: "to deny X, you must presuppose X" where X = knowledge (Finnis) or X = valuation of continued existence (Chris). Chris's version may be more defensible because it makes a narrower claim — not a list of seven specific basic goods, but the general point that acting presupposes valuation.

## 11. Patterns, Lessons, and Open Questions for Chris's Formulation

### What the lineage confirms

1. **The move is well-established.** Chris is not making a novel argument — he is making an argument with a 2,400-year pedigree. This is a strength, not a weakness. It means the argument has survived sustained attack.

2. **The structural template works for logic.** Aristotle's defense of LNC via retortion is widely (though not universally) accepted. The question is always whether the extension to ethics is valid.

3. **Apel is the strongest ally.** His *Letztbegründung* is the most explicit version of "performative contradiction as fourth option beyond Agrippa's trilemma." Chris should engage deeply with Apel.

### What the lineage warns about

1. **The "too thin" problem.** Every version of this argument faces the objection that what is performatively presupposed is too minimal to ground substantive ethics. Chris's version handles this better than most by explicitly limiting the claim: performative grounding grounds the convergent core, not the margins.

2. **The over-derivation problem.** Hoppe derived an entire political philosophy; Gewirth derived a full rights system; Korsgaard derived the categorical imperative. In each case, critics argue the derivation goes beyond what the performative contradiction supports. Chris should resist the temptation to derive too much.

3. **The universalization gap.** Getting from "I presuppose valuation" to "all agents have rights/obligations" is the hardest step. Gewirth, Korsgaard, and Hoppe all face their strongest objections here. Chris's framework may not need this step (the scope confusion model handles inter-agent obligations differently), but this should be made explicit.

4. **Habermas's retreat is significant.** If Habermas — who helped develop the concept — ultimately decided performative contradiction is heuristic rather than justificatory, this should give pause. What does Chris's argument claim to do that Habermas decided couldn't be done?

5. **The ontological vs. transcendental ambiguity.** Does performative grounding show that values are *real features of reality*, or only that *we cannot help presupposing them when we act*? Aristotle faced this about LNC; Chris faces it about valuation. The morality framework seems to want the realist answer, but the argument as stated may only deliver the transcendental one.

### Open questions for further research

1. Does the move from "presuppositions of argumentation" (Apel) to "presuppositions of action in general" (Chris/Gewirth) strengthen or weaken the argument?
2. Is Chris's "performative grounding" closer to Apel's *Letztbegründung* or Habermas's more modest identification of discourse rules?
3. Can the scope confusion framework handle the universalization step without needing Gewirth's or Korsgaard's apparatus?
4. What is the relationship between Wittgenstein's "hinges" and Chris's "you hit reality, and reality doesn't need justification"?
5. Is Finnis's retorsive argument about the self-evidence of basic goods a parallel track or a competing approach?
