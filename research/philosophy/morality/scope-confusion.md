# The Scope Confusion Thesis
> Most political and legal disagreements are not about values — they're about which scope a value claim belongs to.

**Status:** active — formalizing
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Links:** [Morality](./README.md), [Legal Theory](../legal-theory/README.md), [Mens Rea](../legal-theory/mens-rea.md), [Opposing Forces](../opposing-forces.md), [Civilizational Cycles](../civilizational-cycles.md), [Demolition Man Analysis](../../demolition-man-analysis.md)

## The Three Scopes

The [morality framework](./README.md) defines three overlapping circles:

| Scope | Domain | Enforcement | Applies to |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Morality** | Individual conscience | Self-discipline, guilt, personal standards | The individual |
| **Ethics** | Group norms | Social pressure, reputation, ostracism | Communities, professions, cultures |
| **Law** | Codified rules with legal consequences | Courts, restitution, retribution | Everyone within a jurisdiction |

These overlap but do not nest. Not all moral convictions become group norms. Not all group norms become law. And there are laws with no moral basis.

## The Thesis

**Scope confusion** is the error of applying enforcement mechanisms from one scope to claims that belong to another.

Most political conflict is not about whether something is good or bad — it's about which scope the claim belongs to and therefore *who gets to enforce it and how*.

### The Enforceability Gradient

**Hypothesis:** The enforceability of a moral claim is inversely proportional to its dependence on subjective utility.

| Claim | Utility Agreement | Proper Scope | Enforceability |
|-------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| "Don't murder" | Near-universal | Law | High — almost everyone's utility function agrees |
| "Don't steal" | Near-universal | Law | High |
| "Keep your promises" | Very broad | Law (contract) / Ethics | High for explicit contracts; ethics handles the rest |
| "Care for your children" | Very broad | Ethics / Law (neglect) | Broad biological convergence; legal edge cases |
| "Don't use drugs" | Partial | Ethics (community norms) | Contested — utility agreement is partial |
| "Don't eat pork" | Narrow (religious) | Morality | Low — depends on specific religious utility |
| "Wake up at 5am" | Individual | Morality | None — purely personal optimization |

The contested middle — drugs, speech, sexuality, diet — is contested *precisely because* the utility agreement is partial. Some people's utility functions include strong preferences about others' behavior in these domains. Others don't. The political fight is about which scope wins.

### Scope Confusion in Practice

**Pushing morality into law (theocratic error):**
Banning alcohol, drugs, pornography, blasphemy, homosexuality. These are moral claims (many people genuinely believe these are wrong) enforced at the legal level. The problem: legal enforcement requires *near-universal* utility agreement to be legitimate. When it doesn't exist, you get black markets, selective enforcement, and erosion of legal legitimacy.

**Pushing law into morality (libertine error):**
"If it's legal, it's fine." Legality is a floor, not a ceiling. Something can be legal and still immoral or unethical. A person who lies constantly, betrays trust, and exploits loopholes violates no law but deserves social sanction (ethics scope) and personal judgment (morality scope). Collapsing all three scopes into law strips society of its non-legal enforcement tools.

**Pushing ethics into law (regulatory capture):**
Professional norms, industry standards, best practices — these are ethical-scope phenomena. When codified into law (occupational licensing, regulatory compliance), they become tools for incumbents to exclude competitors. Olson's institutional sclerosis (from [Civilizational Cycles](../civilizational-cycles.md)) is partly a scope confusion story: ethical norms that worked as voluntary standards become legal barriers that resist change.

**Denying scope distinctions entirely (utopian error):**
Cocteau in [Demolition Man](../../demolition-man-analysis.md) — every preference is optimized, every deviation is illegal. There is no private morality because all morality is law. This is the ultimate scope confusion: collapsing all three circles into one.

## Scope Confusion as the Mechanism Behind Civilizational Decay

The [master cycle](../civilizational-cycles.md) — voluntary cooperation → institutional consolidation → institutional capture → coercion → collapse — can be read as a scope confusion progression:

1. **Voluntary cooperation** — each scope operates independently. Morality guides individuals, ethics guide communities, law protects rights. High trust.
2. **Institutional consolidation** — ethical norms get codified into law because "they work." This seems efficient.
3. **Institutional capture** — the codified norms become tools for rent-seeking (Olson). Law now enforces what should be voluntary ethical standards.
4. **Coercion** — moral claims are enforced by law. Dissent is criminalized. The scopes have collapsed.
5. **Collapse** — legitimacy evaporates because law has claimed authority it doesn't have. Trust is gone.

The ratchet is one-directional: moving claims *up* in scope (morality → ethics → law) is easy because it feels like "doing something." Moving claims *down* (deregulation, decriminalization, returning judgment to individuals) is hard because it feels like "abandoning standards."

## Connection to Mens Rea

The [mens rea debate](../legal-theory/mens-rea.md) is a specific instance of scope confusion.

**The claim:** Intent matters when judging wrongdoing.

**Where it belongs:** Morality and ethics. When Alice considers whether to forgive Bob, she cares about his intent. When a community judges character, intent is central. These are legitimate exercises of moral and ethical judgment.

**Where it doesn't belong:** Law. The legal question is: was property violated, and by whom? Intent is a moral judgment about character. Inserting it into law means the legal system is doing morality's job — judging people's souls rather than protecting rights.

**Why people resist this:** Because the desire to punish evil is deep. We don't just want restitution — we want the bad person to *suffer for being bad*. That instinct is real, but it's a moral instinct. Encoding it into law means using state power to enforce moral judgments about character — which is the theocratic error applied to the justice system.

**The pushback IS the evidence:** The resistance to removing mens rea from law is itself evidence for the scope confusion thesis. People feel that law *should* judge character. The framework predicts exactly this reaction and identifies it as a category error.

## Formalization Needed

This thesis needs:

1. **A criterion for scope assignment.** What determines which scope a claim belongs to? The enforceability gradient (utility agreement) is a start, but needs formalization. How do you measure "utility agreement" across a population?

2. **A theory of legitimate scope transitions.** Some moral claims *should* become law (e.g., the abolition of slavery was a moral claim that became legal). What distinguishes legitimate scope promotion from scope confusion? Candidate: the convergence test — if independent civilizations converge on the same moral claim across centuries, it's tracking something real and may warrant legal codification.

3. **Engagement with existing literature.** This connects to:
   - Haidt's moral foundations theory (empirical data on which moral intuitions are widespread vs. culturally specific)
   - Mill's harm principle (an attempt to draw the morality/law boundary)
   - Hart-Devlin debate (1960s — should law enforce morality?)
   - Hayek's distinction between law and legislation
   - Fuller's inner morality of law

4. **Stress-testing against hard cases.** The easy cases (murder = law, diet = morality) aren't interesting. The hard cases are: hate speech, drug policy, assisted suicide, polygamy, prostitution. Can the enforceability gradient predict where the political fight will be?

## Open Questions

- Is the enforceability gradient continuous or does it have natural breakpoints?
- Does the scope confusion thesis predict which *direction* political movements push? (Progressives push ethics → law? Libertarians push law → morality?)
- How does scope confusion interact with [opposing forces](../opposing-forces.md)? Does over-legislating morality *generate* the libertine counter-reaction?
- Can the convergence test distinguish "humanity is converging on truth" from "humanity shares cognitive biases"?
- Is there a fourth scope? International law / civilizational norms? Or is that just ethics at a larger scale?
