## Starting Definitions

Three overlapping circles, scaling from individual to institutional:

- **Morality** — right and wrong at the level of the individual conscience. The most fundamental layer.
- **Ethics** — group norms of right and wrong. How communities and societies codify expected behavior.
- **Law** — codified ethics that carry legal consequences. The formal, enforceable subset.

These overlap, not nest. There are moral truths no group has recognized (morality outside ethics). There are group norms never codified (ethics outside law). There are laws with no moral basis (law outside morality).

## Prerequisites for Morality

Morality requires three conditions to exist:

1. **Physical reality** — the universe has causal structure; actions have consequences determined by how things actually work.
2. **Consciousness** — outcomes are *experienced*, not just occurring. A rock "experiences" falling, but not in a morally relevant sense.
3. **Agency (choice)** — the capacity to select between actions. This is the critical differentiator. A tsunami that kills thousands is not evil. A person who kills thousands is. The difference is choice.

**Implication:** In a hard-deterministic universe with no genuine choice, morality is meaningless — we are all rocks. This framework *depends* on free will being real. That dependency is accepted.

**Kant's formulation:** "Ought implies can." You cannot have moral obligations without the capacity to choose.

## The Is-Ought Problem (Hume's Guillotine)

The central challenge: just because something *is* a certain way does not mean it *ought* to be. Observing nature doesn't logically compel moral conclusions.

### The Conditional Approach

An "ought" can be derived from an "is" *when constraints are defined*. "If you are sick, you ought to see a doctor" — but only if you value living longer. The ought is real but conditional (Kant called these *hypothetical imperatives*).

The spectrum of constraints:
- **Tight:** "If you want to not die today, eat." Nearly universal, but a hunger striker opts out.
- **Loose:** "If you're a social creature, cooperate." Broad, but a hermit rejects the premise.
- **Very loose:** "If you're alive, preserve your life." Most organisms default to this, but suicide exists.
- **Inescapable?:** "You exist and must act." — Can this be opted out of?

The natural law play: find a constraint so fundamental to being a conscious agent that rejecting it is incoherent. The "thrown into existence" argument — you are a conscious agent in a physical universe with fixed rules, you *must* act, even inaction is a choice. The structure of reality is not optional.

This gets us to "you must choose." The remaining question was whether it gets all the way to "some choices are objectively better."

### The Resolution: Performative Grounding (2026-02-28)

The is-ought gap dissolves — not through logical bridging, but through **performative grounding**.

**The key move:** Ask "should I care about self-destruction?" This question is meaningless — not because it lacks an answer, but because the person asking it has *already answered it* by being alive, acting, and choosing to ask. Their behavior demonstrates a preference for continued existence that their words are pretending to question. This is a **performative contradiction**: the act of questioning presupposes what the question purports to doubt.

**Why this escapes Agrippa's trilemma:**

Agrippa says every justification chain terminates in one of three ways:
1. **Infinite regress** — why? why? why? forever
2. **Circular reasoning** — A because B because A
3. **Axiomatic assertion** — I assert this without further justification

Performative grounding is none of these. An axiom is "I assert this, take it or leave it." Performative grounding is "your own actions demonstrate this whether you assert it or not." You cannot opt out of acting. Even refusing to act is an act. The regress stops not because you hit a logical floor, but because you hit **reality** — and reality doesn't need justification, it just is. "Ought the moon exist?" is not an unsolved problem; it's a category error. The moon doesn't need justification. Human existence, human action, human preference-for-continued-existence — same thing.

**Why Hume was right but incomplete:**

Hume was correct that you cannot derive ought from is *through logic alone*. But he was looking for a logical bridge when the questioner is already standing on the other side. Existence isn't a premise in a syllogism — it's the condition that makes syllogisms possible. The "ought" isn't derived from the "is." The "is" already contains the "ought" because actors who exist *are already acting*, and acting is choosing, and choosing presupposes valuation.

**The grounding chain:**
1. **You exist and must act** — empirical fact, undeniable
2. **Some actions demonstrably destroy the actor** — empirical fact, observable via [measurement chains](../../philosophy/epistemology/README.md) from reality (fire burns, betrayal isolates, self-destruction terminates agency)
3. **"Why avoid self-destruction?"** — the asker is demonstrating the answer by asking; the question is a performative contradiction

**What this grounds and what it doesn't:**

This resolves the is-ought gap at the **core** but not at the **margins**. It grounds the convergent norms — don't murder, don't steal, don't betray every ally — because these are the cases where performative contradiction is strongest. The person arguing for murder is relying on a social fabric they'd be destroying.

It does *not* ground the margins: short and intense vs. long and cautious, art preferences, lifestyle choices. Different weightings of objective measurements remain genuinely subjective at this level (see [The Weighting Problem](../epistemology/weighting-problem.md)). But the framework doesn't need to ground everything — only enough to justify the [enforceability gradient](./scope-confusion.md) in scope confusion. The norms that approach universal convergence are precisely the ones where performative grounding is strongest, which is exactly where law-scope enforcement is legitimate.

**Connection to the weighting problem:** This maps to outcome 3 from the [weighting problem analysis](../epistemology/weighting-problem.md#what-this-might-prove) — convergence of weightings at the core tracks real patterns in survival and flourishing (grounded by performative contradiction), while subjectivity persists at the margins where multiple weightings are compatible with continued existence. The conditional-ought escape (outcome 2) serves as the bridging principle.

**Philosophical lineage:** This move has independent precedent across several traditions, reinforcing the convergence argument — multiple thinkers arrived at the same structure from different starting points:

| Thinker | Move | Key Work | Year |
|---------|------|----------|------|
| **Aristotle** | *Retortion* — denying the Law of Non-Contradiction is a performative contradiction; you presuppose it in the act of denying it | *Metaphysics* Gamma 3–4 | ~350 BC |
| **Karl-Otto Apel** | *Letztbegründung* (ultimate justification) via transcendental pragmatics — explicitly proposed as a **fourth option** escaping the Münchhausen/Agrippa trilemma. Argumentation presupposes normative commitments; denying them is a performative self-contradiction | *Towards a Transcendental Semiotics* (Selected Essays Vol. 1); "The Problem of Philosophical Foundations in Light of a Transcendental Pragmatics of Language" (*Man and World*, 1975) | 1973–1998 |
| **Jürgen Habermas** | Discourse ethics — the presuppositions of argumentation (inclusion, sincerity, equal standing) are normative and undeniable. Acknowledged Apel "refuted" the trilemma, though took a more fallibilistic position than Apel's *Letztbegründung* | *Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action* | 1983 |
| **Alan Gewirth** | *Principle of Generic Consistency* — any agent who acts presupposes freedom and well-being as necessary conditions of agency; denying rights to these is a self-contradiction *within the agent's own commitments* | *Reason and Morality* | 1978 |
| **Hans-Hermann Hoppe** | *Argumentation ethics* — the libertarian application. Engaging in argument presupposes self-ownership; advocating against it is a performative contradiction. Closest to our framework's NAP grounding | *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*; "The Economics and Ethics of Private Property" | 1989 |
| **Vittorio Hösle** | Self-referential critique — the trilemma itself is self-refuting; claiming "no ultimate justification is possible" is itself an ultimately justified claim | Referenced in Apel's and Albert's debates | 1990s |

**How our formulation differs:** Most of these thinkers ground the argument in the *presuppositions of argumentation specifically* — you must be arguing to deny it, so the norms of argument are self-validating. Our formulation is broader: it grounds in the *presuppositions of existence and action*, not just discourse. You don't need to be arguing — you just need to be alive and acting, which is a weaker (and therefore stronger) requirement. This sidesteps the main objection to Hoppe (that argumentation only presupposes *use* of the body, not *ownership*) and to Apel (that discourse norms are too narrow to generate full moral content). We're not claiming that discourse has presuppositions; we're claiming that *being an agent at all* has presuppositions, and the agent demonstrates them by existing.

## Moral Content — What Makes a Choice Good?

**Working hypothesis:** Morality is *probabilistic heuristics for human flourishing*, discovered empirically across millennia of civilizational experience.

Key observations:

1. **Religious and cultural norms encode survival wisdom.** Hebrew Kosher laws were food safety rules. "Early to bed, early to rise" is health advice. These aren't arbitrary — they're pattern-matched from generations of lived experience.

2. **Morality updates when constraints change.** Promiscuity was morally "bad" partly because it led to unwanted pregnancy and abandoned children. Birth control changed that constraint — but mental health and relationship stability effects remain. Technology changes the calculus; deeper human realities persist.

3. **Cross-cultural convergence is evidence for objectivity.** Independent civilizations converged on similar moral principles: don't murder, don't steal, keep promises, protect the vulnerable, be courageous, be honest (C.S. Lewis catalogued this in *The Abolition of Man*). This convergence is what you'd expect if moral codes are tracking something real — the same way independent discovery of pi suggests circles are real.

4. **History is error-correcting.** Slavery was competitively advantageous short-term (Rome conquered the world) but bred contempt that couldn't be controlled. Immoral strategies can win for centuries, but the arc bends. Convergent moral intuitions are the *leading indicator*; civilizational outcomes are the *lagging indicator* that confirms or disconfirms them.

5. **Morality is probabilistic, not absolute.** You can't calculate that turning left will cause a fatal accident a mile ahead. But you can know that certain patterns of living reliably lead toward flourishing or degradation. Morality operates at the level of expected value over a lifetime, not certainty about individual choices.

## The Scope Model — Reconciling Updates with Universals

**Methodological note:** This framework is deliberately secular — building the case from reason and evidence, not from theological authority. "Because God says so" is not a foundation; it's the Euthyphro dilemma (Plato): if God commands the good because it's good, then goodness is independent of the command and should be discoverable by reason. If the good is good only because God commands it, morality is arbitrary. The natural law tradition (Aquinas, Lewis) agrees: moral truths are discoverable through reason alone. Revelation may confirm, but reason leads.

**Engagement with Lewis's Tao:** Lewis argues that a universal moral law (the "Tao") exists, is discovered across all civilizations, and cannot be stepped outside of — any moral critique of one part relies on another part. This framework broadly agrees with the convergence evidence but diverges on a key point.

**Lewis says the Tao is received, not derived** — you can't build it from first principles because any principles you'd use are already part of it. This challenges the bottom-up approach taken here. Lewis would also reject the idea that morality "updates" — for him, principles are fixed; only applications vary.

**Our response — expanding scopes:**

Moral principles are real but scope-dependent. The Tao is not a Platonic form floating in the cosmos — it's an objective feature of the *interaction between conscious agents and reality*. Remove either side, it dissolves. Without humans (or analogous agents), there is no Tao. Just physics.

This explains why moral principles have different stability at different scales:

| Scope | Example | Stability |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Narrow** | "Don't be promiscuous" | Updates — birth control changed the risk calculus |
| **Medium** | "Nurture your children" | Persists — human development hasn't changed |
| **Broad** | "Care for the vulnerable" | Very stable — consciousness + dependency is deep |
| **Cosmic** | No agents | No morality. Just physics. |

Lewis's Tao captures the medium-to-broad scope well. The narrow scope is where updating happens. The cosmic scope is where the Tao's independence from agents breaks down.

**Implication:** Change the creature, change the Tao. An alien species with no parental bond would not converge on "nurture your children." The moral law reflects what the agents *are*, not some law independent of them. This is naturalistic, not Platonic.

**Open problem with scope:** Without a criterion for which scope applies when, scope-shifting becomes a tool for justification. "Murder is wrong at the individual scope, but at the civilizational scope, this war is necessary" — every historical atrocity used this move. The scope model needs rules for when zoom-in vs. zoom-out is legitimate. (See: philosophy of logic, planned.)

## Sub-Topics

- [The Scope Confusion Thesis](./scope-confusion.md) — formalizing why most political disagreements are scope assignment errors, not value disagreements. Connects to mens rea, civilizational cycles, and the enforceability gradient.

## Open Questions

These are the frontiers — where the framework is incomplete or under pressure:

1. **Defining "flourishing."** The framework says good choices tend toward flourishing, but what *is* flourishing? Is a short happy life better than a long dreary one? Who decides? This connects to utility theory — and the reason we reject utilitarianism is that group utility can't be maximized or interpersonally compared.

2. **The filter problem.** Cross-cultural convergence includes bad patterns too (slavery, patriarchy, out-group violence). If convergence validates "don't steal," does it validate "subjugate your enemies"? Directionality (error-correction over time) is the proposed filter, but the timescale can be centuries. What does a person living inside an uncorrected error do?

3. **Naming an absolute moral truth.** "Murder is wrong" begs the question (murder = wrongful killing by definition). Theistic "God is good" pushes the is-ought gap to the deity. Can a non-secular absolute be identified? This remains the hardest test.

4. **The timescale problem.** Immoral strategies can dominate for generations. Error correction is a civilizational process, not an individual one. How does an individual navigate when the lagging indicators haven't caught up yet?

5. **~~Completing the is-ought bridge.~~** Resolved via performative grounding (see above). The bridge isn't logical — it's performative. The actor who questions value is already demonstrating it. This grounds the core (convergent norms) while leaving the margins genuinely subjective, which is the correct result for the scope confusion enforceability gradient.
