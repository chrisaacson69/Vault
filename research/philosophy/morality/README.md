## Starting Definitions

Three overlapping circles, scaling from individual to institutional:

- **Morality** — right and wrong at the level of the individual conscience. The most fundamental layer.
- **Ethics** — group norms of right and wrong. How communities and societies codify expected behavior.
- **Law** — codified ethics that carry legal consequences. The formal, enforceable subset.

These overlap, not nest. There are moral truths no group has recognized (morality outside ethics). There are group norms never codified (ethics outside law). There are laws with no moral basis (law outside morality).

## Prerequisites for Morality

Morality requires three conditions to exist:

1. **Physical reality** — the universe has causal structure; actions have consequences determined by how things actually work.
2. **Consciousness** — outcomes are *experienced*, not just occurring. A rock "experiences" falling, but not in a morally relevant sense.
3. **Agency (choice)** — the capacity to select between actions. This is the critical differentiator. A tsunami that kills thousands is not evil. A person who kills thousands is. The difference is choice.

**Implication:** In a hard-deterministic universe with no genuine choice, morality is meaningless — we are all rocks. This framework *depends* on free will being real. That dependency is accepted.

**Kant's formulation:** "Ought implies can." You cannot have moral obligations without the capacity to choose.

## The Is-Ought Problem (Hume's Guillotine)

The central challenge: just because something *is* a certain way does not mean it *ought* to be. Observing nature doesn't logically compel moral conclusions.

**Our approach to the bridge:**

An "ought" can be derived from an "is" *when constraints are defined*. "If you are sick, you ought to see a doctor" — but only if you value living longer. The ought is real but conditional (Kant called these *hypothetical imperatives*).

The spectrum of constraints:
- **Tight:** "If you want to not die today, eat." Nearly universal, but a hunger striker opts out.
- **Loose:** "If you're a social creature, cooperate." Broad, but a hermit rejects the premise.
- **Very loose:** "If you're alive, preserve your life." Most organisms default to this, but suicide exists.
- **Inescapable?:** "You exist and must act." — Can this be opted out of?

The natural law play: find a constraint so fundamental to being a conscious agent that rejecting it is incoherent. The "thrown into existence" argument — you are a conscious agent in a physical universe with fixed rules, you *must* act, even inaction is a choice. The structure of reality is not optional.

**Status:** The bridge is partially built. The inescapable situation of agency gets us to "you must choose." The open question is whether it gets us all the way to "some choices are objectively better."

## Moral Content — What Makes a Choice Good?

**Working hypothesis:** Morality is *probabilistic heuristics for human flourishing*, discovered empirically across millennia of civilizational experience.

Key observations:

1. **Religious and cultural norms encode survival wisdom.** Hebrew Kosher laws were food safety rules. "Early to bed, early to rise" is health advice. These aren't arbitrary — they're pattern-matched from generations of lived experience.

2. **Morality updates when constraints change.** Promiscuity was morally "bad" partly because it led to unwanted pregnancy and abandoned children. Birth control changed that constraint — but mental health and relationship stability effects remain. Technology changes the calculus; deeper human realities persist.

3. **Cross-cultural convergence is evidence for objectivity.** Independent civilizations converged on similar moral principles: don't murder, don't steal, keep promises, protect the vulnerable, be courageous, be honest (C.S. Lewis catalogued this in *The Abolition of Man*). This convergence is what you'd expect if moral codes are tracking something real — the same way independent discovery of pi suggests circles are real.

4. **History is error-correcting.** Slavery was competitively advantageous short-term (Rome conquered the world) but bred contempt that couldn't be controlled. Immoral strategies can win for centuries, but the arc bends. Convergent moral intuitions are the *leading indicator*; civilizational outcomes are the *lagging indicator* that confirms or disconfirms them.

5. **Morality is probabilistic, not absolute.** You can't calculate that turning left will cause a fatal accident a mile ahead. But you can know that certain patterns of living reliably lead toward flourishing or degradation. Morality operates at the level of expected value over a lifetime, not certainty about individual choices.

## The Scope Model — Reconciling Updates with Universals

**Methodological note:** This framework is deliberately secular — building the case from reason and evidence, not from theological authority. "Because God says so" is not a foundation; it's the Euthyphro dilemma (Plato): if God commands the good because it's good, then goodness is independent of the command and should be discoverable by reason. If the good is good only because God commands it, morality is arbitrary. The natural law tradition (Aquinas, Lewis) agrees: moral truths are discoverable through reason alone. Revelation may confirm, but reason leads.

**Engagement with Lewis's Tao:** Lewis argues that a universal moral law (the "Tao") exists, is discovered across all civilizations, and cannot be stepped outside of — any moral critique of one part relies on another part. This framework broadly agrees with the convergence evidence but diverges on a key point.

**Lewis says the Tao is received, not derived** — you can't build it from first principles because any principles you'd use are already part of it. This challenges the bottom-up approach taken here. Lewis would also reject the idea that morality "updates" — for him, principles are fixed; only applications vary.

**Our response — expanding scopes:**

Moral principles are real but scope-dependent. The Tao is not a Platonic form floating in the cosmos — it's an objective feature of the *interaction between conscious agents and reality*. Remove either side, it dissolves. Without humans (or analogous agents), there is no Tao. Just physics.

This explains why moral principles have different stability at different scales:

| Scope | Example | Stability |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Narrow** | "Don't be promiscuous" | Updates — birth control changed the risk calculus |
| **Medium** | "Nurture your children" | Persists — human development hasn't changed |
| **Broad** | "Care for the vulnerable" | Very stable — consciousness + dependency is deep |
| **Cosmic** | No agents | No morality. Just physics. |

Lewis's Tao captures the medium-to-broad scope well. The narrow scope is where updating happens. The cosmic scope is where the Tao's independence from agents breaks down.

**Implication:** Change the creature, change the Tao. An alien species with no parental bond would not converge on "nurture your children." The moral law reflects what the agents *are*, not some law independent of them. This is naturalistic, not Platonic.

**Open problem with scope:** Without a criterion for which scope applies when, scope-shifting becomes a tool for justification. "Murder is wrong at the individual scope, but at the civilizational scope, this war is necessary" — every historical atrocity used this move. The scope model needs rules for when zoom-in vs. zoom-out is legitimate. (See: philosophy of logic, planned.)

## Sub-Topics

- [The Scope Confusion Thesis](./scope-confusion.md) — formalizing why most political disagreements are scope assignment errors, not value disagreements. Connects to mens rea, civilizational cycles, and the enforceability gradient.

## Open Questions

These are the frontiers — where the framework is incomplete or under pressure:

1. **Defining "flourishing."** The framework says good choices tend toward flourishing, but what *is* flourishing? Is a short happy life better than a long dreary one? Who decides? This connects to utility theory — and the reason we reject utilitarianism is that group utility can't be maximized or interpersonally compared.

2. **The filter problem.** Cross-cultural convergence includes bad patterns too (slavery, patriarchy, out-group violence). If convergence validates "don't steal," does it validate "subjugate your enemies"? Directionality (error-correction over time) is the proposed filter, but the timescale can be centuries. What does a person living inside an uncorrected error do?

3. **Naming an absolute moral truth.** "Murder is wrong" begs the question (murder = wrongful killing by definition). Theistic "God is good" pushes the is-ought gap to the deity. Can a non-secular absolute be identified? This remains the hardest test.

4. **The timescale problem.** Immoral strategies can dominate for generations. Error correction is a civilizational process, not an individual one. How does an individual navigate when the lagging indicators haven't caught up yet?

5. **Completing the is-ought bridge.** We have: existence + consciousness + agency + inescapable constraints of reality. Does this actually *compel* moral conclusions, or does it only compel *practical* conclusions (engineering/survival) that we're calling moral?
