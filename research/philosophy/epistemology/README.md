# Epistemology — Parking Lot
> How we know what we know. The foundation underneath everything else.

## Why This Matters

Both the morality and logic/math frameworks rest on epistemological claims (structural realism, convergence as evidence, empirical discovery of moral patterns). Those claims need their own examination.

## Threads to Explore

### Structural Realism as Foundation
The position running underneath everything: reality has structure, our formalisms (logic, math, moral codes) model that structure, convergence across independent observers is evidence of objectivity. This is an epistemological claim that needs to be examined on its own terms.

### The Objectivist Epistemological Chain
Peikoff (*Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand*) and Rand (*Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology*) lay out a bottom-up epistemology worth engaging with:

1. Existence exists (axiom)
2. Consciousness is conscious (axiom)
3. A is A — the law of identity (axiom)
4. Logic as "the art of non-contradictory identification"
5. Concepts formed by measurement omission from perception
6. Senses are valid (direct realism)
7. Primacy of existence over consciousness

**Points of agreement:** Bottom-up method. Secular grounding. Reason as primary tool. Reality as independent of consciousness.

**Points of friction:**
- **A = A as absolute** — quantum mechanics challenges identity at fundamental levels. Our position: identity is a reliable macro-scale pattern, not a cosmic axiom. Large-scale superposition experiments are pushing this boundary.
- **Concept formation as uniquely human** — Rand explicitly claims this. The evidence disagrees. Primates demonstrate fairness intuitions, elephants mourn, cetaceans cooperate strategically. If concept formation (or proto-concept formation) exists on a gradient across species, the hard human/animal boundary in Objectivist ethics breaks down.
- **Logic as discovered vs. constructed** — Objectivists treat logic as objective and discovered. We hold it is constructed but convergent — a subtle but important difference (see [Logic and Mathematics](../logic-and-math/README.md)).

**Value of the engagement:** The Objectivists are the closest philosophical neighbors — same method, same secular commitment, same bottom-up approach. The disagreements are sharpest precisely because the shared ground is so large. Peikoff is particularly valuable for his systematic mapping of philosophical history and the interrelations between positions.

### Non-Human Concept Formation and Its Implications
If consciousness + agency are the prerequisites for morality, and these exist on a gradient across species, then:
- Epistemology is not exclusively human
- Morality is not exclusively human
- Both scale with cognitive complexity
- The hard human/animal boundary is a spectrum, not a wall

Evidence: capuchin monkeys reject unequal rewards (fairness intuition), great apes use tools and plan ahead (agency), elephants perform death rituals (abstract awareness), corvids solve novel problems (reasoning). These aren't just stimulus-response — they imply something like concept formation.

This undermines Objectivist epistemology at a key joint and strengthens the naturalistic position: cognition is a biological phenomenon that exists on a continuum.

### The "Logic Is Self-Referential" Problem
To argue that logic is a construction, you use logic. Is this a fatal circularity or just a normal feature of any foundational inquiry? (Compare: using English to argue that English is a human construction is obviously unproblematic.) Needs further examination.

### Convergence as Epistemological Evidence
The convergence argument is used across multiple domains:
- Math: independent discovery of pi, Pythagorean theorem → math tracks real patterns
- Morality: independent development of similar moral codes → morality tracks real patterns
- Science: independent replication → scientific laws track real patterns

What are the limits of this argument? When does convergence indicate truth vs. shared cognitive bias? (Every culture also developed rain dances — convergent but wrong.)
