## The Principle

When evaluating anything with multiple measurable attributes, three distinct operations occur:

| Step | Operation | Can it be objective? |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1. **Measurement** | Determine the value of each attribute | Yes — instruments, counts, frequencies |
| 2. **Selection** | Choose which attributes are relevant | No — requires a judgment about what matters |
| 3. **Weighting** | Assign relative importance to each selected attribute | No — requires a valuing mind |

The composite judgment inherits the subjectivity of steps 2 and 3 regardless of how objective step 1 is. Using objective inputs does not make the output objective. The aggregation function — the formula that turns multiple measurements into a single ranking or yes/no determination — is where subjectivity enters and cannot be removed.

### The Core Argument

If a domain has N objective metrics, and any two rational agents can assign different weights to those metrics and reach different conclusions, then the composite determination is not purely objective. The *existence* of persistent expert disagreement in a domain (art critics, legal scholars, moral philosophers, economists) is diagnostic: if the determination were objective, convergence would be expected.

Contrast with domains where convergence *does* occur: measurement of physical constants, mathematical proofs, simple categorization (is this a parrot?). These domains either have a single metric or have a non-arbitrary aggregation procedure.

## Where It Shows Up

### Economics — Subjective Value Theory
The weighting problem *is* subjective value theory, expressed in epistemological terms. A good has multiple objective properties (weight, durability, color, scarcity). The *value* of the good is not derivable from those properties — it depends on which properties the evaluator cares about and how much. This is Menger's insight: value is ordinal, subjective, and exists in the mind of the holder. See [Value and Profit](../../economics/value-and-profit.md).

The baseball card parable from the [art debate](../../debates/art-objectivity-noerr-strange.md): a book says the card is worth $300 (objective measurement of market consensus). But "your card is only worth what someone's willing to pay for it" — the actual value depends on the buyer's weighting function.

### Law — Balancing Tests and Sentencing
Legal standards routinely require weighing multiple factors:
- **Sentencing guidelines** — severity, prior record, remorse, circumstances. Each measurable; the composite sentence is a judgment call.
- **Reasonable person standard** — what would a reasonable person do? Requires weighting competing considerations (caution vs. autonomy, cost vs. safety).
- **Constitutional balancing** — strict scrutiny weighs government interest against individual rights. Both are "objective" in some sense; the balance is not.

This connects to [Legal Theory](../legal-theory/README.md): if legal determinations require subjective weighting, then the aspiration to "objective law" has a ceiling. Restitution (making the victim whole) may be the legal domain most resistant to the weighting problem — the metric is singular (restore what was lost). Retribution and deterrence are where weighting enters.

### Morality — Competing Values
The moral framework faces the weighting problem when values conflict:
- Liberty vs. safety (the classic political spectrum axis)
- Individual rights vs. collective welfare
- Mercy vs. justice
- Present generation vs. future generations

Each value can be articulated and even measured in specific contexts. The *priority ordering* between them when they conflict is the weighting function — and it's where all the political disagreement lives. See [Scope Confusion](../morality/scope-confusion.md): the enforceability gradient is an attempt to resolve the weighting problem for moral claims by tying enforcement scope to utility agreement. If everyone's weighting function converges (don't murder), it becomes law. If weightings diverge (drug policy), it stays at ethics or morality.

### Science — Theory Selection
When multiple theories fit the observed data, scientists choose between them using criteria: simplicity (Occam), explanatory power, predictive accuracy, elegance, unification. Each criterion can be articulated. The *weighting* of criteria is where scientific paradigm disputes live. Kuhn's "incommensurability" is partly a claim that scientists in different paradigms assign different weights to these criteria.

### Art — The Debate That Surfaced This
The [art objectivity debate](../../debates/art-objectivity-noerr-strange.md) is where this principle was derived in real time. Rob Noerr demonstrated it through multiple test cases:
- **Giza vs. Cholula** — Giza wins on more metrics; Cholula wins on sheer size. Who decides which matters?
- **Tom Brady vs. Michael Vick** — one metric (clutch accuracy) can outweigh five others. Why?
- **Football Hall of Fame** — same stats, different expert rankings.
- **Death metal vs. rap** — objective skill within each genre; genre preference is the weighting function.

## Tension With the Vault's Framework

This principle creates a genuine tension with the vault's epistemological commitments:

### The Convergence Argument Under Pressure
The [epistemology stub](./README.md) identifies convergence across independent observers as evidence of objectivity. The weighting problem challenges this: convergence on *measurements* (step 1) is strong evidence. But convergence on *weightings* (step 3) is weaker — it could indicate shared cognitive bias rather than tracking objective truth. Every culture developed rain dances too.

**However:** The convergence argument may survive in a modified form. If independent civilizations converge on the same *priority ordering* of values (don't murder > don't steal > don't lie > personal preference), that's convergence on a weighting function, which is harder to explain by shared bias alone. The ordering is too specific and too consistent to be coincidence. This might mean some weighting functions track real patterns even if weighting *in general* is subjective.

### Structural Realism and the Weighting Problem
Structural realism holds that reality has structure and our formalisms model that structure. The weighting problem asks: does reality have a *ranking structure*, or only a *measurement structure*? If reality contains objective measurements but no objective rankings, then structural realism is true but limited — it tells you what's there, not what matters.

**Possible resolution:** Reality might contain *conditional* rankings. "If your goal is X, then weighting W is optimal" could be an objective fact. This would make the weighting problem dissolve under specified goals and persist only when goals themselves are contested. This is the "conditional ought" structure already present in the [morality framework](../morality/README.md): "if you want to survive, then don't murder" is an objective conditional even if "you should want to survive" is not.

### What This Might Prove
Three possible outcomes:

1. **Subjectivity is irreducible at the composite level.** Measurements can be objective; rankings cannot. This doesn't destroy the vault's framework — it constrains where objectivity lives. Morality, law, and value have objective *components* but subjective *composites*.

2. **The conditional-ought escape works.** Weighting is subjective only because goals are subjective. If you fix the goal, the optimal weighting becomes objective. The remaining question is: can goals themselves be grounded? (This is the is-ought gap again.)

3. **Convergence of weightings is itself evidence of objective ranking structure.** The near-universal priority ordering of values across civilizations isn't explained by shared bias. It tracks real patterns in what works for survival and flourishing. Subjectivity exists at the margins (art, cuisine, lifestyle); the core is objective.

These aren't mutually exclusive. The answer might be: outcome 3 for the core, outcome 1 for the margins, and outcome 2 as the bridging principle.

## Formalization Needed

1. **Distinguish measurement-convergence from weighting-convergence.** When experts converge, is it on the measurements or on the weights? These provide different evidence for objectivity.

2. **Identify domains where weighting is non-arbitrary.** Are there domains where the aggregation function is determined by the structure of the problem? (Candidate: engineering — the weighting of bridge safety metrics is constrained by physics, not preference.)

3. **Test the conditional-ought escape.** If you specify a goal (maximize human flourishing, minimize suffering, maximize profit), does the optimal weighting become objectively determinable? If so, the weighting problem reduces to the is-ought gap: the measurements and the weightings can both be objective once you accept the goal.

4. **Catalog the weighting problem across vault domains.** Each instance (economics, law, morality, science, art) may have different characteristics. Some may be more resistant to the problem than others.

## Open Questions

- Is the weighting problem the *same* problem as the is-ought gap, or a sibling?
- Can machine learning find "natural" weighting functions from data? If an algorithm trained on all human art judgments converges on stable weights, does that constitute objectivity or just aggregated subjectivity?
- Does the weighting problem apply to single-metric domains? Or only multi-attribute ones? (Murder is wrong — is this a single-metric judgment or does it have hidden weights?)
- Where does the weighting problem sit relative to Agrippa's trilemma? Is the weighting function itself subject to the regress? (Why these weights? Because of these meta-weights. Why those meta-weights? ...) **Partial resolution:** The core weighting (convergent norms) escapes the regress via [performative grounding](../morality/README.md#the-resolution-performative-grounding-2026-02-28) — the actor questioning the weighting is already demonstrating it. The marginal weightings remain genuinely subjective, which is consistent with outcome 3 above.
