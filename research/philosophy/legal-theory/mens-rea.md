# Mens Rea in Libertarian Law
> Debate: does criminal intent (mens rea) have a place in a legal system built on the NAP and natural law?

**Status:** active (literature review added)

## Positions

- **Chris (mens rea NOT required):** Aggression is binary — you are an aggressor or you are not. Intent is irrelevant to whether a property right was violated. The legal system should be objective and intent-blind.
- **Claude (mens rea IS required):** Intent is embedded in the NAP's language ("aggression," "initiation") and is necessary to distinguish fraud from misfortune and calibrate proportional response.

## The Debate

### Opening: Is intent embedded in the NAP?

**Claude's argument:** The NAP prohibits *aggression* — a word that carries intentionality by definition. You can't "aggress" accidentally. Stripping intent changes the principle from "non-aggression" to "non-harm," which is a different (and more burdensome) standard.

**Chris's counter (implicit):** The big-L Libertarian position already considers any property violation as aggression, including borrowing without permission and returning the item. The framework has already defined aggression more broadly than everyday usage.

### The Alice and Bob Problem

**Setup:** Alice trades an apple for Bob's promise of a banana tomorrow.
- **Case 1:** Bob's banana is stolen overnight. He can't deliver. No intent to defraud.
- **Case 2:** Bob never intended to deliver. The contract was a mechanism to steal Alice's apple.

**Claude's argument:** Case 2 isn't breach — it's theft by deception (fraud). Identifying fraud *requires* examining intent. Without mens rea, fraud is impossible to prosecute as anything worse than breach of contract, making the expected cost of fraud zero.

**Chris's counter:** Both cases result in aggression against Alice. Both owe restitution. Contract terms or common law can include retribution (penalties for breach) that deter fraud without examining intent. The penalty makes fraud expensive regardless of whether you can prove it was fraud.

### The Seizure Test

**Claude's test case:** Bob has a seizure and falls into Alice, breaking her arm. Is Bob an aggressor?

**Chris's response:** Alice is owed restitution. It's not Alice's fault her arm was broken. The question is about the *victim's* rights, not the perpetrator's mental state.

**Resolution:** This clarified that restitution is victim-focused and doesn't require mens rea. The question isn't "what was Bob thinking?" but "was Alice's property violated and who is responsible?"

### The Fork

**Claude's argument:** Without mens rea, either:
1. Bob IS an aggressor despite the seizure → you've replaced the NAP with strict liability
2. Bob is NOT an aggressor because he had no agency → mens rea just walked in

**Chris's resolution:** Restitution is owed in both cases. The *classification* question (aggressor or not) is less important than the *practical* question (who owes whom). Focus on the victim.

### The Thought Crime Counter

**Chris's counter:** If mens rea matters, what about someone who INTENDS to commit a crime but doesn't? If intent matters, why not prosecute intent alone?

**Claude's response:** You need BOTH actus reus (guilty act) AND mens rea (guilty mind). Neither alone is sufficient. This creates a 2x2 matrix:

| Intent | Action | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| No | Yes (seizure) | Restitution only |
| Yes | No (thought crime) | Nothing — no victim |
| Yes | Yes (fraud/assault) | Full NAP violation |
| No | Yes (accident) | Restitution only |

**Chris's counter:** This matrix still doesn't justify mens rea in law. Rows 1 and 4 are handled by restitution. Row 2 is nothing. Row 3 is also handled by restitution + retribution. The matrix describes reality but doesn't require the legal system to examine intent.

### The Dirty Mind-Reading Problem

**Chris's core objection (two prongs):**

1. **Mens rea is "dirty"** — it's functionally mind reading. You cannot prove what someone was thinking. It introduces subjectivity into a system that should be objective.

2. **Mens rea tries to punish "evil"** — the legal system shouldn't judge moral character. It should protect rights and make victims whole.

**Claude's attempted workaround:** Use "behavioral evidence of fraud" (pattern of breaches, circumstantial evidence) instead of probing mental states.

**Chris's counter:** The same evidence exists whether Bob is an honest fool or a deliberate fraud. "Where there's smoke there's fire" is not proof. Behavioral evidence is just mind reading with extra steps.

### The Perverse Incentives Argument

**Chris's strongest argument (two-pronged):**

**Prong 1 — Carefulness incentive:** A woman slips on ice and kills another driver. If "it was an accident" reduces her liability, she has LESS incentive to be maximally careful. Equal consequences for accidents and intentional acts creates maximum incentive for caution.

**Prong 2 — Malicious actor loophole:** If the law says "accidents get lesser punishment," malicious actors just need to MAKE IT LOOK like an accident. Removing mens rea closes this loophole — disguising intent becomes worthless because intent doesn't affect the outcome.

**Claude's concession:** The incentives argument is strong on both prongs.

### The Car Example (Retribution Without Mens Rea)

**Chris's example:** Someone flatbeds your car while you're on vacation, doesn't use it, returns it before you get back. You're fully restored. But aggression occurred — unauthorized control of your property violates the NAP regardless of harm.

**Key insight:** Restitution is already complete, but retribution is still justified. The violation was of the *right to control* your property, not of the property itself. This retribution doesn't need mens rea — the multiplier is set by contract, convention, or victim's choice, not by intent analysis.

### Resolution: Where Flexibility Lives

**Chris's framework:**
- **The law** stays clean: aggression is binary, restitution + retribution are owed, no intent analysis
- **The people** provide flexibility:
  - Alice can forgive Bob because his crop was stolen (victim's discretion)
  - Communities weigh circumstances when determining restitution for hard cases (death)
  - Arbitrators can consider context because parties *choose* arbitrators they trust
- **Mercy is voluntary, not codified** — it happens at the individual/community level, not the legal level

**Claude's concession:** The strongest surviving argument for mens rea was "the market would reinvent it." Chris's answer: "Yes, and that's fine — people exercising voluntary judgment is libertarian. Codifying it in law is not."

### Connection to Morality Framework

This maps directly to the morality/ethics/law distinction from the [morality work](../morality/README.md):
- **Morality** (individual): Alice decides whether to forgive Bob — personal judgment about right and wrong
- **Ethics** (group norms): Community conventions about retribution levels — shared standards
- **Law** (codified): Aggression is binary, restitution is owed — objective, intent-blind rules

Mens rea belongs in the morality and ethics circles. The law circle stays clean.

## Literature Review: Causation, Aggression, and Responsibility

Two papers in the libertarian literature directly address the questions raised in our debate. They represent opposing camps within Rothbardian legal theory on how far intent and causation should reach.

### Kinsella & Tinsley — "Causation and Aggression" (2004)

[Source](https://stephankinsella.com/2004/11/causation-and-aggression-2004/) | *Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics* 7, no. 4

**Thesis:** Libertarian legal theory must be grounded in praxeology. Aggression requires *intentional action* — without intent there is no action, without action there is no actor to hold responsible. Punishing unintentional movements would be like punishing natural forces.

**Key arguments:**

- **Humans as means:** A terrorist mails a letter-bomb via an unwitting courier. The courier has no intent, so the terrorist bears full responsibility — he *used* the courier as a means. Extends to criminal conspiracies, hired assassins, military commanders.
- **Free will doesn't break causal chains:** Challenges Rothbard and Block, who argue that because the rioter/hitman has free will, the inciter/hirer can't be responsible. Kinsella says this would absurdly excuse mob bosses.
- **The "evil midget" test:** Whether a remote-controlled tank contains machinery or a hidden human operator, the controller bears identical liability. The mechanism is irrelevant; what matters is intentional deployment of means.
- **No "fixed pie" of responsibility:** Multiple actors can each bear 100% liability (joint and several). Instigator's culpability doesn't reduce intermediary's guilt.
- **Block's exceptions are ad hoc:** Block says incitement-by-words is fine (free speech) but incitement-by-payment (hitman) is criminal. Why? Both involve free choice by the intermediary. The exceptions collapse without principled justification.
- **Foreseeability standard:** Intervening acts only break causation when *unforeseeable*. Borrowed from the Restatement of Torts.

**Relation to our debate:** Kinsella's core thesis — "without intent there is no action" — is a praxeological argument for mens rea at the foundation. This is stronger than Claude's original linguistic argument. However, Kinsella's focus is on the *instigator's* intent (did you intentionally deploy means?), not on grading the *perpetrator's* mental state for sentencing purposes. This is a narrower form of mens rea than what traditional legal systems use.

### Mortellaro — "Causation and Responsibility: A New Direction" (2009)

[Source](https://mises.org/libertarian-papers/causation-and-responsibility-new-direction) | *Libertarian Papers* 1, no. 24

**Thesis:** Defends and *radicalizes* the Rothbardian position. Accepts some critiques (Hoppe's fault requirement, entrapment as aggression) but argues the class of prohibited activities should be *shrunk*. All forms of incitement — by words, money, or threats — should be non-criminal for the inciter.

**Key arguments:**

- **Accepts fault as prerequisite:** Following Hoppe/Reinach, fault (intent or negligence) is necessary to distinguish *action* from *mere behavior*. Eliminates the seizure problem — no action in the Misesian sense, no aggressor. But this is a refinement of Rothbard, not a departure.
- **Accepts entrapment as aggression:** Employer orders worker to walk a path with a concealed trap. No "overt physical invasion" by the employer, but clearly criminal. Rejecting "Block's Paradox" (two individually licit acts can't combine into an illicit one) is a welcome correction to the NAP, not a threat to it.
- **Rejects failed attempts:** Husband poisons wife's tea, but pharmacist sold harmless powder. Proportional restitution for zero harm is *zero*. No victim, no case. Analogous to praying for someone's death — belief in effectiveness doesn't create liability.
- **Alternative two-part test for human means:**
  1. Are the human means **aware** of what they are doing?
  2. Is the employer of the human means **necessary** for the crime?
- This handles clean cases correctly: courier is unaware (terrorist liable), bank heist members are each necessary (all liable). But it REJECTS incitement — the rioters were *aware* and the inciter was *unnecessary*.
- **Hitman contracts are not criminal for the hirer:** The hitman has free will exactly like the rioter. Block's inconsistency: why does money override free will but words don't? Austrian subjective value theory — money and psychic goods (gratitude, group belonging) are not categorically different.
- **Incitement-by-extortion:** A threatens B into killing C. A is liable *to B* (for the threat) but not *to C*. B was aware and A was unnecessary for the physical commission. The extortion creates liability, not the incitement.
- **Conclusion:** The NAP is a *basis for judging legal systems*, not a complete one. Property owners can forbid anything on their territory. A free society might sanction inciters through voluntary means — social pressure, ostracism, restrictive covenants — without force.

**Relation to our debate:** Mortellaro's paper aligns with Chris's position in several ways:
- The awareness/necessity test is *objective* — it asks observable questions, not "what were you thinking?"
- The failed-attempts argument (zero harm = zero restitution) is exactly Chris's victim-focused reasoning
- The conclusion mirrors Chris's morality/ethics/law layering: the *law* stays clean, the *people* provide flexibility
- His stance on incitement is even more radical than Chris's — even obvious intent (hitman contracts) doesn't make the inciter an aggressor

### Where Both Papers Challenge Our Positions

**Challenge to Chris's framework:**
- Both papers accept that fault/intent is needed at a minimum to distinguish *action* from *mere behavior*. Even Mortellaro adopts Hoppe's Reinach-influenced position: "fault must always be found." This is a minimal mens rea — not to grade punishment, but to identify whether *action* occurred at all.
- Kinsella's unwitting courier case is hard to handle without intent analysis. The courier *caused* the harm, but nobody would hold him liable. Why not? Because he lacked intent. Chris's restitution-focused approach would need to answer: does the courier owe Alice restitution?

**Challenge to Claude's framework:**
- Mortellaro's awareness/necessity test achieves most of what mens rea aims to do (distinguish innocent actors from guilty ones) using *observable criteria* rather than mental state analysis. This undercuts the argument that you *need* traditional mens rea.
- Mortellaro's proportionality argument against failed attempts (zero harm = zero restitution) directly supports Chris's position that the system should focus on the victim's loss, not the perpetrator's mind.
- His point about estoppel and punishment is devastating to Kinsella's incitement position: if incitement is criminal, the proportional punishment is... incitement back. Hardly worth prosecuting.

### The Incitement Question (New Ground)

Neither our debate nor the original open questions addressed incitement directly, but it is the central battleground in both papers and poses the hardest test cases:

- **Soapbox orator incites riot:** Rothbard says non-criminal (free will of rioters). Kinsella says criminal (mob was the means). Mortellaro says non-criminal (rioters were aware, orator was unnecessary). Chris's framework: rioters owe restitution, orator does not — no property was violated by the speech act.
- **Hitman contract:** Block says criminal (payment = "part of gangster activity"). Kinsella says criminal (hitman was a means). Mortellaro says non-criminal for the hirer (hitman was aware and capable without help). Chris's framework would likely agree with Mortellaro — the hitman is the aggressor, the hirer merely influenced.
- **Entrapment (boss + concealed trap):** All three agree this is aggression. Hoppe's fault criterion handles it. Chris's framework: the victim's property was violated, and the boss's action was the *necessary* cause.

Mortellaro's two-part test (awareness + necessity) may be a cleaner resolution to the incitement problem than anything we explored. It's objective, doesn't require mind-reading, and produces intuitively correct results across the test cases.

## Round 2: Fault, Free Will, and Proximate Cause (2026-02-18)

After reviewing both papers, a second round of debate refined Chris's position and identified a deeper problem in the literature.

### The Fault Compromise

Chris observed that everyone — including himself — agrees you must determine WHO is responsible. The disagreement is about whether this requires examining mental states. A building collapse illustrates the point:

- **Building collapses on invited guest:** The owner's structure, the owner's responsibility. No intent analysis needed. The objective facts determine fault — whose building was it? Was it structurally sound?
- **Guest trips on property:** Probably the guest's own fault. Was there a hazard the owner created, or did the guest just stumble? Physical evidence answers this, not intent.

**Key distinction:** "Fault" can mean two different things:
- **Fault as causal responsibility** — whose property/action was the proximate cause? (objective)
- **Fault as mental state** — what did you intend? (subjective, mind-reading)

The literature conflates these. Hoppe/Reinach say "fault must always be found" and mean intent/negligence. Chris agrees fault must be found but redefines it as *causal responsibility* — an objective inquiry into the physical facts, not a probe of mental states.

Negligence resolves cleanly under this framing: the building owner was "negligent" not because of their mental state but because *it was their building and their responsibility to maintain it*. The failure to maintain is an objective fact about the property, not a state of mind.

### Kinsella's Methodological Problem

Chris identified that Kinsella imports US positive law (Model Penal Code, Restatement of Torts) to operationalize his framework. The foreseeability standard ("intervening acts only break causation when unforeseeable") is doing enormous work but is inherently a *reasonable person* standard — a community judgment, not a natural law derivation. If the NAP generated these distinctions naturally, you wouldn't need to borrow them from a 1985 legal code.

This doesn't mean Kinsella's conclusions are necessarily wrong — the same results might be derivable from first principles. But the method is contaminated by his background as a US attorney, leading him to reach for familiar legal positivist tools rather than deriving from the NAP directly.

### The Free Will Principle

The literature's deepest problem: everyone starts from "aggression requires intent" (praxeology), but then every author immediately hits cases that break this and has to bolt on extra machinery — foreseeability (Kinsella), fault (Hoppe), awareness/necessity (Mortellaro), ad hoc exceptions (Block). The fact that *nobody's* starting premise survives unpatched suggests the premise has a problem.

Chris's reframing: **liability doesn't flow from action — it flows from property violation.** The praxeological claim that "action requires intent" is true but irrelevant. Buildings aren't actors. Ice on sidewalks isn't an actor. And yet property gets violated by all of these. The question isn't "did someone *act* aggressively?" (requires intent analysis) but "was property violated, and whose property/responsibility was the proximate cause?" (requires only causal analysis).

This also reframes the mob boss / incitement problem. Chris's position:

- **Free will is foundational to libertarianism** — you own yourself because you are a self-directing agent
- **If free will is real, nobody can *make* you commit a crime** through words, money, or social pressure
- **The hitman CHOSE to pull the trigger.** The rioter CHOSE to riot. Saying the mob boss "caused" the murder treats the hitman as a mechanism, not a person — denying the very agency libertarianism is built on.
- **Blaming upstream actors diverts responsibility** from the actual perpetrator and creates a system where people point upstream ("he told me to do it")
- **This is the same logic used to restrict free speech** — "dangerous speech causes violence" assumes listeners are lemmings. A society that accepts this will always trend toward censorship.

**The clean rule:** Free will in the causal chain assigns proximate cause to the free agent. Uninformed participants (courier, entrapped employee) didn't exercise meaningful free will on the relevant question, so cause passes through them. Informed participants (hitman, rioter) exercised their will freely, so cause stops with them. No intent analysis, foreseeability standards, or ad hoc exceptions needed.

The building collapse fits this rule perfectly: no free will agent intervened between the building and the victim. The owner's property was the direct cause. The entrapment case also fits: the employee didn't exercise free will on the relevant question (he didn't know about the trap). The mob boss case also fits: the hitman DID exercise free will, so cause stops with him.

### The Deeper Observation

Even the most committed libertarian thinkers struggle to follow their own principles to their conclusions. This isn't a criticism — it is genuinely hard to imagine a world built on principles you've never seen fully implemented. Chris notes that his experience as a programmer (building systems from axioms) and his autism (reasoning from structure rather than social convention) may make it easier to follow principles past the point where social intuition says "but that can't be right."

This also suggests that these principles may have always existed and are simply being *refined* over time — the same way mathematical truths exist before anyone writes them down. Common law, Rothbard, Hoppe, Kinsella, and this conversation are all successive approximations of the same underlying structure.

## The Scope Confusion Argument (2026-02-22)

The [scope confusion thesis](../morality/scope-confusion.md) provides the meta-framework that explains *why* the mens rea debate is so persistent and *why* removing it from law feels wrong to most people.

**Mens rea is scope confusion.** The desire to examine intent is a moral instinct — we want to judge character, punish evil, distinguish the wicked from the unlucky. That instinct is *correct* at the morality scope (individual conscience) and *appropriate* at the ethics scope (communities judging character). It is a category error at the law scope.

The legal question is: was property violated, and by whom? This is an objective inquiry. Adding "and what was the violator thinking?" imports morality-scope judgment into a system that should be scope-limited to rights protection.

**The pushback is the evidence.** People resist removing mens rea from law because they feel law *should* judge character. The scope confusion thesis predicts exactly this reaction: when you try to move a claim *down* in scope (from law to ethics/morality), it feels like "abandoning standards." The ratchet runs one direction — pushing moral claims into law feels like "doing something," while pulling them back out feels like permissiveness.

**Connection to free speech:** The incitement analysis from the debate below follows the same pattern. "Dangerous speech causes violence" is a morality-scope claim (the speaker bears moral responsibility for inspiring harm) pushed into law (the speaker should be legally liable). The scope confusion thesis predicts this: if you accept that law should judge intent, there is no principled boundary preventing the criminalization of speech that *might* inspire bad acts. Mens rea in criminal law and speech restrictions share the same structural error.

**Connection to the civilizational cycle:** The [master cycle](../civilizational-cycles.md) describes societies moving from voluntary cooperation through institutional capture to coercion. One mechanism: moral claims get codified into law during the consolidation phase ("it works, so mandate it"), become tools for control during the capture phase, and produce the legitimacy crisis during the coercion phase. Mens rea's long history — from Roman law through common law to the Model Penal Code — may be an instance of this ratchet.

## Open Questions

### Resolved or Partially Resolved
- ~~Where does **negligence** fit?~~ → Negligence is about *whose responsibility it was* (objective), not mental state. The building owner's duty to maintain is a fact about ownership, not about their thoughts.
- ~~Does the **unwitting courier case** break the framework?~~ → The free will principle handles it: the courier didn't exercise meaningful free will on the relevant question (didn't know about the bomb), so cause passes through to the terrorist.
- ~~Is Mortellaro's **awareness + necessity test** sufficient?~~ → It's close but potentially overcomplicated. The free will principle (informed free agent = proximate cause) may be simpler and covers the same cases.

### Still Open
- Does this framework handle **repeat offenders** adequately? If each breach is treated as an isolated incident, is there a mechanism to identify and respond to serial fraud?
- How does the **restitution for death** problem resolve? What does "making whole" mean when the victim can't negotiate?
- Does **shared ownership** (marriage, partnerships) create complications for the binary aggression model?
- How do **insurance markets** interact with this framework? Would insurers effectively reinstate mens rea through pricing?
- **Duress edge cases:** If A holds a gun to B's head and says "kill C or I kill you" — B exercises free will technically, but under extreme constraint. Does the free will principle still assign proximate cause to B? Chris's preliminary answer: yes, B is liable to C, and A is liable to B for the threat. But this needs stress-testing.
- **Degrees of information:** The free will principle hinges on whether the agent was "informed." But information is a spectrum, not binary. Partially informed participants (someone who suspects but doesn't know) need a cleaner treatment.
- **Connection to free speech:** The incitement analysis implies strong free speech protections. Worth connecting formally to the [free speech debate](./README.md) listed in upcoming topics.
