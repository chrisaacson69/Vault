## Framework

Starting position: **big-L Libertarian** — Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), natural law theory, private property as axiomatic. Hoppe, Rothbard, and the argumentation ethics tradition.

### Core Legal Principles (working framework)

1. **Aggression is binary** — you violated someone's property/person or you didn't. Intent is irrelevant to the classification.
2. **Restitution** — makes the victim whole. Automatic, objective, no intent analysis needed.
3. **Retribution** — deters future violations. Set by three layers:
   - **Contract** — pre-agreed penalties between parties
   - **Convention / common law** — community-established norms
   - **Victim's discretion** — the aggrieved party can forgive, reduce, or enforce
4. **Mercy lives in the people, not the code** — voluntary human judgment handles the nuance that the law deliberately excludes.

### Framing Principle

The current system is closer to libertarian law than libertarians often admit. Marriage, corporations, common law retribution — these are centuries of practical solutions to the same property rights problems. The libertarian contribution isn't "start over" — it's providing a principled framework to evaluate which parts the existing system got right and which drifted. See: [Words of Wisdom](../../../notes/words-of-wisdom.md)

### Method

These topics are explored through adversarial debate — Chris takes one position, Claude takes the opposing, and we stress-test from first principles. The goal isn't to "win" but to map the terrain and find where arguments break.

## Debates

- [Mens Rea](./mens-rea.md) — does criminal intent have a place in libertarian law?
- [Government Formation and Structure](./government-formation.md) — why government forms (division of labor), the ancap challenge, and the Constitution as a distributed system protocol

## Upcoming Topics

- **Marriage under natural law** — can marriage exist in a NAP framework, or does it require fundamental restructuring?
- **Shared ownership** — can property be jointly owned under libertarian law, and what are the implications?
- **Fraud as aggression** — deeper exploration of how fraud is prosecuted without mens rea
- **Restitution for death** — what does "making whole" mean when the victim is dead?
- **Free speech: "speech" vs. "expression"** — courts have ruled that the 1st Amendment covers expression broadly (art, symbolic acts, code, etc.), but does the text actually support this? "Speech" could mean the written or spoken word only — but this narrow reading doesn't hold up to modern technology (what about digital communication, AI-generated content, video?). A fine line worth exploring, though highly contentious given centuries of litigation. The question may be less about what the Founders *meant* and more about whether a 1789 text can cover a 2026 landscape without either stretching the word past its meaning or leaving obvious gaps.
- **The 2nd Amendment as preventive check** — the amendment's purpose is deterrence (preventing disarmament), not last-resort revolution. Key insight from a judged debate: evaluating it by whether armed overthrow has been used as a legal defense is a non-existent standard; evaluating it by guns having "other uses" conflates the tool with the right. The amendment guards against tyranny by preventing the precondition (disarmament), not by enabling the response (revolution). If you need the gun to stop oppression, it's already too late. Connects to constitutional checks in [Civilizational Cycles](../civilizational-cycles.md) Section X.

## Future Structure

The US Constitution keeps surfacing across multiple vault topics — as an institutional check against civilizational cycles (Section X), as the framework for specific rights debates (2A, 1A), and as a practical case study of constitutional design vs. Hayekian drift. It may warrant its own dedicated page (`constitutional-analysis.md`) examining the document as a whole: what it got right, where it's eroded, how it maps to the cycle theory, and whether a 1789 text can govern a 2026 society.
