## Core Position: Structural Realism

Logic and mathematics are human-built formalisms that model the underlying structure of reality. The patterns they describe are real. The formalisms themselves are constructions — tools, not territory.

This is **structural realism** (or instrumentalism): the map has genuine correspondence to the territory, which is why it works so well. But the map is paper and ink, not asphalt.

Key claims:
1. Logic and math do not exist independently in nature
2. They are extraordinarily useful approximations and models
3. The underlying patterns/structures they describe *are* real
4. Different formalisms can model the same reality (we build new ones when old ones fail)
5. Convergence across cultures reflects shared reality, not discovery of Platonic forms

## Challenges to Classical Logic from Reality

### Law of Identity (A = A)

**Challenge: Quantum superposition.** In the double-slit experiment, a particle demonstrably passes through both slits simultaneously, interfering with itself. It is not "A or not-A waiting to be revealed" — it is genuinely in an indeterminate state until observed. Classical identity breaks at the quantum level.

Quantum logic exists as a field precisely because classical logic cannot handle quantum phenomena. The fact that we had to build a new logic suggests logic is a tool we construct, not a fixed feature of reality.

### Law of the Excluded Middle (P or not-P)

**Challenge: Continuous systems.** Classical logic is binary; reality often is not. An analog neural net's activation isn't "firing" or "not firing" — it's a continuous value. "How many clouds are in the sky?" doesn't have a clean integer answer (the sorites paradox — where does one cloud end and another begin?).

Fuzzy logic and intuitionistic logic were developed to handle cases where the excluded middle fails. Again: we keep building new logics because reality doesn't obey the old ones.

### Completeness and Consistency (Godel)

**Godel's incompleteness theorems** show that any formal system powerful enough to express basic arithmetic is either incomplete (contains true statements it cannot prove) or inconsistent (can prove contradictions), but not both.

This means logic *cannot fully capture even arithmetic*. A tool with built-in limits on what it can express is clearly a tool, not a complete mirror of reality. Logic is powerful but bounded — and it knows it.

## Numbers as Abstractions

**The sheepherder example:** A herder makes notches on his staff, one per sheep. He aligns staff to flock — if they match, all sheep are present. He doesn't need the concept of "13" — just one-to-one correspondence. The number is the abstraction built on top of the physical matching.

**Counter-argument acknowledged:** One-to-one correspondence (bijection) is itself a mathematical concept. The sheepherder is "doing math" whether or not he knows it. But the question is whether the *pattern* exists independently or only in the interaction between an agent and the world. We hold: the sheep are there, the correspondence is there, but "13" is the human layer.

## The Unreasonable Effectiveness Problem

Wigner (1960) asked: why does math work so unreasonably well at predicting physical phenomena?

- Dirac's equation predicted antimatter before observation
- Einstein's field equations predicted gravitational waves a century before detection
- Maxwell's equations predicted electromagnetic radiation from pure math

**Our response:** A map built by carefully studying the territory *should* be predictive. The correspondence is earned, not magical. We remember the math that works and forget the math that doesn't (selection bias). And even the best maps have edges — Newtonian mechanics was "unreasonably effective" until it wasn't, and we built a new map (relativity).

**Acknowledged tension — imaginary numbers:** Complex numbers are *required* by the Schrodinger equation, not merely convenient. Renou et al. (2021) showed that real-valued quantum mechanics makes different predictions than complex-valued QM, and experiments favor the complex version. The math may be capturing structure deeper than intended. This doesn't prove Platonism, but it means the "just a model" claim must account for models that seem to know more than their builders.

## Math Forced to Fit

Mathematical formalisms are often adapted, extended, or reinterpreted to fit new problems — further evidence of construction rather than discovery:

- Imaginary numbers originated as a "trick" for solving cubic equations, later found structural roles in physics
- Non-Euclidean geometry was considered a curiosity until general relativity needed it
- Renormalization in quantum field theory was called "sweeping infinities under the rug" by its own creators

When math doesn't fit, we build new math. When logic doesn't fit, we build new logic. Discoverers don't need to keep redesigning their discoveries.

## Consistency with the Morality Framework

This position forms a unified epistemological foundation across the vault:

| Domain | What's real | What's constructed |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Physics** | The patterns, structures, causal relations | The mathematical formalisms describing them |
| **Logic** | The rational structure of reality | The formal systems modeling it |
| **Morality** | The patterns of flourishing/degradation | The moral frameworks articulating them |

All three are maps tracking real territory. All three converge across cultures because independent observers model the same underlying reality. All three get refined over time. None are Platonic forms existing independently of agents interacting with reality.

## Open Questions

1. **Where does "good model" end and "real feature" begin?** If complex numbers are genuinely required by quantum mechanics, at what point does a formalism stop being "just a model" and start being a feature of reality? Is there a clear boundary, or is this a spectrum?

2. **The epistemology dependency.** This entire framework rests on claims about what we can know and how — which is epistemology. The logic/math position and the morality position both assume structural realism. That assumption needs its own examination. (Planned: [Epistemology](../epistemology/))

3. **Logic as prerequisite for reasoning about logic.** To argue that logic is a construction, you use logic. Does this self-reference undermine the position, or is it like using English to argue that English is a human construction — obviously true and unproblematic?

4. **The "new math" pattern.** We keep building new formalisms when old ones fail. Does the *process* of building-and-testing formalisms converge on something, even if individual formalisms are constructions? Is there a meta-pattern?
