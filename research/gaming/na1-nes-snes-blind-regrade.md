# NA1 NES ↔ SNES — grading two blind reverse-engineerings

> Nobunaga's Ambition was reversed twice, independently: the **NES** original as a bytecode-VM
> title (`na1-decompiler`, emulator-certified) and the **SNES** port as native 65816
> (`na1-snes-decompiler`). This is the *grade*: reconstruct the game's architecture and formulas
> from the SNES code **alone** (treating the NES work as unverified), then diff. Two binaries, two
> consoles, two execution models, two toolchains — and they agree on **every structurally-checkable
> fact and every derived formula**. That agreement is the "one C source, two compile targets" thesis
> proven the hard way.

[The Three-Layer Method](../karpathy-three-layer-method.md). Repos: `na1-snes-decompiler` (SNES),
`na1-decompiler` (NES oracle — used only to *grade*, never to derive).

## The method — create, then check (verification independence)

Two strict phases per section. **CREATE:** derive the section's structure + constants from the SNES
native code only, without opening the NES conclusions. **CHECK:** only once a claim is fixed, diff it
against the NES work — matches mutually validate, mismatches grade both. Feeding the NES answers in as
context would bias the re-derivation toward agreement and destroy the independence that makes the
cross-check mean anything. (Purest form of verification-independence = dropping to a lower, independent
artifact — here the second binary — not asking a second agent.)

## The scorecard — five sections, all converged

| Section | Key result | Grade |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup / world-gen** | 26-byte fief record (SoA parallel arrays); **1560 scenario data byte-identical** at twin ROM addresses (17-fief `$C3:903D`↔NES `$3:9258`; 50-fief `$C3:BB0D`↔NES `$3:B0BE`) | ✅ exact |
| **Economy** | Grow = `2·amt·(6−skill)/√(output+amt)`, √-diminishing + `(6−skill)` handicap + hidden loyalty/dams drain | ✅ **identical formula** |
| **Turn-start / events** | cadence `rng(2)`/`rng(4)`/`rng(40)<3`; illness `rng(400)<100−health`; **Fall (season 2) harvest**; Riot(loyalty) vs Revolt(morale) | ✅ all exact |
| **AI turn** | weighted-coin-flip cascade; weakest-adjacent-by-men-ratio; state-5 = human; difficulty lives in the constants; subsidized not skilled | ✅ all match |
| **Combat** | `(115−15·skill)` handicap (AI 100%, player scaled); casualties `pct_op(men,pct)+(pct≥50?1:0)`; **8-stat weight table `{5,5,10,10,10,15,20,25}` sum 100 → +40%**; 3 unit types (Rifles>Cav>Inf, +100% rank term) | ✅ identical |

Field map (both, header-first in ROM): `header, gold, debt, town, rice, output, dams, loyalty(+12),
wealth, men(+16), morale(+18), skill(+20), arms(+22)`.

## What the port actually changed — and what it froze

**Changed (QoL / presentation):** sectioned command menus; explicit unit **icons + names**
(Infantry/Cavalry/Rifles — a 3-type system the NES *already had* but only exposed in its manual); a
single-image strategic map (vs paged); more scenarios; 10-byte name slots (NES 9). The RAM map carried
over almost verbatim — `game_year $2001`, difficulty `$2D63`↔NES `$6D63`, twin-address scenario tables.

**Frozen:** the *game*. Same formulas, same 8-stat combat table, same difficulty-as-handicap
(`115−15·skill` combat, `6−skill` economy — applied to the **player**, AI runs at 100%), same
weakest-neighbour AI. The **AI got no smarter across the hardware leap** — a 16-bit CPU with room for
search or lookahead still runs the 1986 weighted-coin-flip cascade. KOEI *chose* the shallow opponent;
it was a design philosophy, not a compute limit. "Not fair, but a challenge" — subsidy over skill.

**The one real architectural change — the combat resolver was unified.** The NES ran *two* battle
resolvers: the tactical sim, plus a cheaper **simplified auto-resolve** for off-screen AI-vs-AI battles
(bytecode-confirmed). The SNES has **one** — `run_turn`'s tactical sim is the only resolver;
`try_attack`/`execute_attack` are tactical-only (per-unit-contact), reachable solely via `run_battle`,
with no strategic aggregate shortcut (`$2E6B` queues nothing here). So SNES auto-resolve is the *same*
deterministic sim run **headless** — `anim_attack` + cursor boxes + VBlank waits skipped, math untouched.
Hardware-driven: the 6502 couldn't afford full tactical AI for every off-screen skirmish (hence the NES
approximation); the 65816 could, so the approximation was dropped. It's the lone place the hardware leap
changed the *engine* rather than the *presentation* — while leaving the AI and every formula frozen.

*Strategic consequence.* On the NES the two resolvers churned **different casualties** — the tactical
fight ground the loser down "to the man," auto-resolve was lax — so watching enemy battles was a near-
mandatory *weapon* (you watched to maximize a rival's losses; auto let them off easy). The SNES
unification removes that lever: identical casualties drawn or not, so `[Don't View]` is a pure time-save
at zero strategic cost. A player's sense that watching "does nothing" is independent behavioral
corroboration of the one-resolver callgraph. *Precise clincher (open):* an emulator RAM-diff — watch vs
`[Don't View]` from the same seed, casualties compared to the soldier.

## The combat "tarnish"

Combat strength is a many-term additive aggregate — `men + terrain(defensive) + lord-military-compare
+ unit-type + unit-rank(+100% when favored) + 8-stat W(+40%)`, all ×`(115−15·skill)`. The unit rank
(Rifles>Cav>Inf) is **one +100% term**, not a 4× damage multiplier — fief Skill (weight 25) and daimyo
IQ (20) dominate the contest. Casualties are then a deterministic `pct_op(men, p)`; only **Bribe** rolls
dice (`rng(0..5−skill)+morale+Charisma` — a defection contest that flips men, *not* melee attrition).
The result is combat math too tangled to intuit at the table — legible only once fully enumerated.

## The play isn't in the engine — positional strategy

The graded mechanics collapse to one strategic truth: **the combat engine is a red herring.** The AI
decides one fief at a time, opportunistically (`is_favorable = calc_combat_odds < 50`, adjacency-gated),
and the `(115−15·skill)` handicap it applies *only to human fiefs* deflates your apparent strength in its
own odds math — a **targeting magnet**, not merely softer attacks: an equally-statted AI fief is "safe,"
your identical fief wears a soft-target sign. So the winning game is entirely positional, and the elaborate
combat math almost never gets to matter:

- **Don't be the weakest among your neighbors, and don't become it** — the literal negation of the AI's
  one-ply decision function. You never need *global* strength, only local, and only enough to fail each
  neighbour's favorability gate *given your handicap*. "Attack only when you can hold" is the same rule
  forward: an ungarrisoned conquest just mints a new weakest-border-fief for the next AI turn to pile onto.
- **Front-load before the subsidy compounds.** Your daimyo stats are frozen at the character roll; the AI's
  **drift upward every turn** and its economy is subsidized (`6−skill`, `init_ai_budget`, Fall boost). Your
  edge is *maximal on turn 1 and decays monotonically* — so the speedrun rushes: max-reroll all 5 stats
  (winning the daimyo half of the 8-stat table outright), exploit that **assassination has no AI counter**
  (unreachable from the AI turn; it never retaliates diplomatically), seed the `$2E17` turn order to chain
  decapitations, then buy the leaderless lands and pack the new men into chokepoints before the AI catches up.

**Placement beats lord class** — the sharpest statement of the thesis. Speedruns start **Miyoshi in Settsu**,
only a *B-class* lord, because he is ringed by weak, easily-assassinated neighbours — a soft opportunity
field. One of the *hardest* starts is **Uesugi in Echigo**, an **A-class** lord, precisely because he sits
among other A/S daimyo and must grind wins out of the best defensive fief in the game. A strong lord among
titans is worse-placed than a middling lord among weaklings — exactly what an adjacency-local, opportunistic
engine predicts. The engine's complexity is nearly a magic trick: it hides how little the engine actually
decides. See [The Hollow Opponent](./hollow-opponent-perceived-depth.md) and
[The Dead-Verb Test](./dead-verbs-mechanism-viability.md).

## What the exercise demonstrated about method

And a coverage lesson the *questions* surfaced: the "100% label-walk (715/715)" was 100% of the
**direct-call + syscall** routines — but the **player command verbs are a 4th indirect-dispatch island**
(~94 routines behind the command jump tables, `mul32_a`→table→indirect `JSR`), invisible to a DFS from
`main`, exactly like the syscall island. Asking "what are the non-economy verbs?" is what exposed it;
enumerating the tables and walking their targets brought the total to **821 routines, ~809 named**.
*"100% of the walk" ≠ "100% of the program" when dispatch is indirect — census every jump table.*

Every discrepancy across five sections was a **CREATE-phase over-read from the lossy C decompiler**
(record-field offsets; "seeding is generated" — it's a fixed ROM copy; "SNES added a 2nd loyalty stat"
— it's morale relabeled; "daimyo folded into the fief record" — they're separate, the fief outlives its
lord). The blind-then-check discipline **caught each before it was committed**, while the SNES native
code independently reproduced the NES's emulator-certified numbers (Grow, illness, the 8-stat weights,
the casualty formula). Two independent reverse-engineerings agreeing at the arithmetic level is the
strongest oracle either one could have.
