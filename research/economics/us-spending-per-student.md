## Summary

Real (inflation-adjusted) spending per student in US public K-12 schools has increased dramatically over the past six decades. Multiple independent sources confirm the same basic trajectory: roughly a **3-4x increase since 1960** in constant dollars, with the sharpest growth in the 1960s, steady increases through the 2000s, a post-recession dip around 2012-13, and renewed increases through the present.

## Historical Per-Pupil Expenditure (Current Expenditures, Constant Dollars)

The figures below are drawn from NCES, Census Bureau, Reason Foundation, and OECD data. All are inflation-adjusted. Dollar bases vary by source (noted where available), but the growth pattern is consistent across all of them.

### Decade-by-Decade Trajectory (NCES / GAO / Statista, constant dollars)

| School Year | Per-Pupil Current Expenditure | Dollar Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1959-60 | ~$4,060 | est. 2022-23 $ | NCES 236.55 (Reason: 280% increase to ~$15,400 by 2019) |
| 1969-70 | $2,903 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 1979-80 | $3,934 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 1989-90 | $5,327 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 1990 | $12,206 | 2022-23 $ | Statista / NCES |
| 1992-93 | $5,296 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 2002 | $14,969 | 2023 $ | Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight (Census/NCES) |
| 2010-11 | $14,453 | 2022-23 $ | NCES Fast Facts #66 |
| 2012-13 | $13,952 | 2022-23 $ | NCES Fast Facts #66 (post-recession low) |
| 2016 | $13,600 | 2021 $ | OECD / NCES (international comparison basis) |
| 2019 | $15,500 | 2021 $ | OECD Education at a Glance |
| 2020-21 | $16,280 | 2022-23 $ | NCES Fast Facts #66 |
| 2021-22 | $15,591 | adj. $ | NCES Press Release May 2024 |
| 2023 | $20,322 | 2023 $ | Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight (total revenues/student) |

**Note:** The GAO figures use 1993-94 dollars; the NCES/Statista figures use 2022-23 dollars; the OECD uses 2021 constant USD; and the Reason Foundation uses 2023 dollars. The absolute amounts differ due to the base year, but the growth rates are consistent.

### Growth Rates Across Eras (from multiple sources)

| Period | Real Growth | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1960s | ~58% | EPI (Allan Odden) |
| 1970s | ~27% | EPI (Allan Odden) |
| 1980s | ~30% | EPI (Allan Odden) |
| 1967-1991 | ~61% | EPI (inflation-adjusted) |
| 1960-2019 | ~280% | Reason Foundation / NCES |
| 2002-2023 | 35.8% | Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight |
| 2010-2021 | 13% | NCES Fast Facts #66 |
| 2005-2016 | 8% | OECD |
| 2010-2019 | 6% | OECD |

## Where the Money Goes (2002-2023, Reason Foundation)

- **Employee benefits** (pensions, health insurance): up 81.1% ($2,221 → $4,022 per student)
- **Employee salaries**: up only 7.7% ($8,449 → $9,098 per student)
- For every **$1** added to salaries, **$3.27** was added to benefits
- Teacher salaries actually **fell 6.1%** in real terms between 2002 and 2022 ($75,152 → $70,548)
- Staffing grew 15.1% while enrollment grew only 4.1%; most new hires were non-teaching roles (+22.8%)

## International Context (OECD, 2019-2022)

- US spends **$15,500** per FTE student at K-12 level (2019), **38% above** the OECD average of $11,300
- At postsecondary level: **$37,400** per FTE, more than **double** the OECD average ($18,400)
- US is 3rd-5th highest spender per student among OECD nations (depending on year and measure)
- Total education investment: **5.8% of GDP** vs. OECD average of 4.7%

## Source Cross-Verification

The following independent sources were checked. All confirm the same directional trend (massive real increase), with figures that are mutually consistent after adjusting for dollar base years:

| Source | Type | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| NCES Digest Table 236.55 | Federal (Dept. of Education) | 1919-2021, constant dollars |
| NCES Fast Facts #66 | Federal (Dept. of Education) | 2010-2021, constant 2022-23 $ |
| NCES CCD Press Release 2024 | Federal (Dept. of Education) | FY 2021-2022 |
| US Census Bureau (via Reason) | Federal (Census) | 2002-2023, state-level |
| GAO HEHS-95-235 | Federal (GAO) | 1970-1993, constant 1993-94 $ |
| Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight | Independent (libertarian think tank) | 2002-2023, Census/NCES data |
| OECD Education at a Glance | International organization | 2005-2022, cross-country |
| EPI (Economic Policy Institute) | Independent (labor-affiliated think tank) | 1967-1991 |
| Statista | Data aggregator | 1990-2021 |

## Methodological Caveat

The EPI raises an important point: using the standard CPI-U to deflate education spending may **overstate** real growth. Education costs are dominated by labor (salaries + benefits = ~80% of current expenditures), and labor costs in education may rise faster than general consumer prices. A services-specific deflator yields a lower but still substantial real increase (61% from 1967-1991 vs. the commonly cited "doubled").

## Key Takeaways

1. **The trend is unambiguous**: real per-pupil spending has risen enormously since 1960 — roughly 3-4x in constant dollars depending on the deflator
2. **Growth has slowed**: the sharpest increases were in the 1960s; recent decades show single-digit percentage growth per decade
3. **Benefits, not salaries, drive cost growth**: the lion's share of spending increases since 2002 went to pensions and health insurance, not teacher pay
4. **The US is a top global spender**: 38% above the OECD average at K-12, double at postsecondary
5. **COVID created a temporary spike**: federal emergency funds drove a 32% increase in federal funding from FY21 to FY22
