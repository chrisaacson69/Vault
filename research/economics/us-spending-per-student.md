## Summary

Real (inflation-adjusted) spending per student in US public K-12 schools has increased dramatically over the past six decades. Multiple independent sources confirm the same basic trajectory: roughly a **3-4x increase since 1960** in constant dollars, with the sharpest growth in the 1960s, steady increases through the 2000s, a post-recession dip around 2012-13, and renewed increases through the present.

## Historical Per-Pupil Expenditure (Current Expenditures, Constant Dollars)

The figures below are drawn from NCES, Census Bureau, Reason Foundation, and OECD data. All are inflation-adjusted. Dollar bases vary by source (noted where available), but the growth pattern is consistent across all of them.

### Decade-by-Decade Trajectory (NCES / GAO / Statista, constant dollars)

| School Year | Per-Pupil Current Expenditure | Dollar Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1959-60 | ~$4,060 | est. 2022-23 $ | NCES 236.55 (Reason: 280% increase to ~$15,400 by 2019) |
| 1969-70 | $2,903 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 1979-80 | $3,934 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 1989-90 | $5,327 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 1990 | $12,206 | 2022-23 $ | Statista / NCES |
| 1992-93 | $5,296 | 1993-94 $ | GAO HEHS-95-235 |
| 2002 | $14,969 | 2023 $ | Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight (Census/NCES) |
| 2010-11 | $14,453 | 2022-23 $ | NCES Fast Facts #66 |
| 2012-13 | $13,952 | 2022-23 $ | NCES Fast Facts #66 (post-recession low) |
| 2016 | $13,600 | 2021 $ | OECD / NCES (international comparison basis) |
| 2019 | $15,500 | 2021 $ | OECD Education at a Glance |
| 2020-21 | $16,280 | 2022-23 $ | NCES Fast Facts #66 |
| 2021-22 | $15,591 | adj. $ | NCES Press Release May 2024 |
| 2023 | $20,322 | 2023 $ | Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight (total revenues/student) |

**Note:** The GAO figures use 1993-94 dollars; the NCES/Statista figures use 2022-23 dollars; the OECD uses 2021 constant USD; and the Reason Foundation uses 2023 dollars. The absolute amounts differ due to the base year, but the growth rates are consistent.

### Growth Rates Across Eras (from multiple sources)

| Period | Real Growth | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1960s | ~58% | EPI (Allan Odden) |
| 1970s | ~27% | EPI (Allan Odden) |
| 1980s | ~30% | EPI (Allan Odden) |
| 1967-1991 | ~61% | EPI (inflation-adjusted) |
| 1960-2019 | ~280% | Reason Foundation / NCES |

## Funding Sources: Local vs. State vs. Federal (NCES / Census / CRS)

The total per-pupil figures above combine **all** funding sources. Here's how the money breaks down by level of government over time:

### Revenue Share by Source (approximate %, NCES Table 235.10 / Census / CRS)

| Decade | Local | State | Federal | Key Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~1920 | 83% | 17% | <1% | Almost entirely local property taxes |
| ~1970 | 52% | 40% | 8% | Local still dominant |
| ~1980 | 43% | 47% | 10% | States take the lead (post-Serrano v. Priest equity lawsuits) |
| ~1990 | 47% | 47% | 6% | Federal share at modern low; local share rebounds |
| ~2000 | 45% | 47% | 8% | Roughly stable split |
| ~2010 | 44% | 44% | 12% | Federal share peaks (ARRA stimulus after Great Recession) |
| ~2020 | 44% | 46% | 11% | COVID relief (CARES/ARP) inflates federal share again |
| FY 2022 | 42.7% | 43.7% | 13.6% | ESSER funds still flowing; $119.1B federal |
| FY 2023 | 42.0% | 45.1% | 12.9% | Federal share begins to decline as COVID funds expire |

### Absolute Dollars (FY 2022, NCES CCD)

- **Total revenues per pupil:** $18,461
- **State:** $383.9 billion (43.7%)
- **Local:** $375.2 billion (42.7%) — primarily property taxes
- **Federal:** $119.1 billion (13.6%)

### Historical Shift

The biggest structural change is the **century-long transfer from local to state funding**:
- In the early 1900s, local property taxes funded ~83% of schools
- By the 1980s, states had overtaken local as the largest single source
- This shift was driven largely by school finance equity lawsuits (Serrano v. Priest, 1971, and its successors), which forced states to equalize funding across property-poor and property-rich districts

The federal share has historically been small (6-13%), spiking only during recessions and emergencies:
- **2009-10:** peaked at ~13% due to ARRA stimulus
- **2020-22:** peaked at ~14% due to CARES/CRRSA/ARP COVID relief ($190B total in ESSER funds)
- As COVID funds expire, the federal share is returning toward its historical ~8-9% baseline

### Important Note on "Total Spending"

The per-pupil figures in the main table above represent **total current expenditures from all sources combined** — local + state + federal. They are not limited to any single funding stream. This was confirmed across NCES (which collects via the National Public Education Financial Survey), the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of School System Finances, and the Reason Foundation's analysis (which merges both).

## Where the Money Goes (2002-2023, Reason Foundation)

- **Employee benefits** (pensions, health insurance): up 81.1% ($2,221 → $4,022 per student)
- **Employee salaries**: up only 7.7% ($8,449 → $9,098 per student)
- For every **$1** added to salaries, **$3.27** was added to benefits
- Teacher salaries actually **fell 6.1%** in real terms between 2002 and 2022 ($75,152 → $70,548)
- Staffing grew 15.1% while enrollment grew only 4.1%; most new hires were non-teaching roles (+22.8%)

## International Context (OECD, 2019-2022)

- US spends **$15,500** per FTE student at K-12 level (2019), **38% above** the OECD average of $11,300
- At postsecondary level: **$37,400** per FTE, more than **double** the OECD average ($18,400)
- US is 3rd-5th highest spender per student among OECD nations (depending on year and measure)
- Total education investment: **5.8% of GDP** vs. OECD average of 4.7%

## Source Cross-Verification

The following independent sources were checked. All confirm the same directional trend (massive real increase), with figures that are mutually consistent after adjusting for dollar base years:

| Source | Type | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| NCES Digest Table 236.55 | Federal (Dept. of Education) | 1919-2021, constant dollars |
| NCES Fast Facts #66 | Federal (Dept. of Education) | 2010-2021, constant 2022-23 $ |
| NCES CCD Press Release 2024 | Federal (Dept. of Education) | FY 2021-2022 |
| US Census Bureau (via Reason) | Federal (Census) | 2002-2023, state-level |
| GAO HEHS-95-235 | Federal (GAO) | 1970-1993, constant 1993-94 $ |
| Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight | Independent (libertarian think tank) | 2002-2023, Census/NCES data |
| OECD Education at a Glance | International organization | 2005-2022, cross-country |
| EPI (Economic Policy Institute) | Independent (labor-affiliated think tank) | 1967-1991 |
| Statista | Data aggregator | 1990-2021 |

## Methodological Caveat

The EPI raises an important point: using the standard CPI-U to deflate education spending may **overstate** real growth. Education costs are dominated by labor (salaries + benefits = ~80% of current expenditures), and labor costs in education may rise faster than general consumer prices. A services-specific deflator yields a lower but still substantial real increase (61% from 1967-1991 vs. the commonly cited "doubled").

## Key Takeaways

1. **The trend is unambiguous**: real per-pupil spending has risen enormously since 1960 — roughly 3-4x in constant dollars depending on the deflator
2. **Growth has slowed**: the sharpest increases were in the 1960s; recent decades show single-digit percentage growth per decade
3. **Benefits, not salaries, drive cost growth**: the lion's share of spending increases since 2002 went to pensions and health insurance, not teacher pay
4. **The US is a top global spender**: 38% above the OECD average at K-12, double at postsecondary
5. **COVID created a temporary spike**: federal emergency funds drove a 32% increase in federal funding from FY21 to FY22
