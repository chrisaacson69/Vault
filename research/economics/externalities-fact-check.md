## The Thesis Under Review

The claim: externalities are not a genuine third category of market failure but decompose into two already-understood problems:

1. **Information propagation failures** — markets self-correct on harmful products once information spreads
2. **Coercive distortions** — coordination failures trace to anti-market interventions (regulation, subsidies, liability shields)

This is a recognizable position with identifiable roots in Coase, Dahlman, the Austrian School, and parts of the Chicago/law-and-economics tradition. Below is what the literature actually says.

## 1. Coase: Externalities as Transaction Cost / Property Rights Problems

### What Coase actually argued

Ronald Coase's 1960 paper "The Problem of Social Cost" (*Journal of Law and Economics*, Vol. 3) made two distinct arguments that are frequently conflated:

**Argument A (the "theorem," zero-transaction-cost case):** If transaction costs are zero and property rights are well-defined, private bargaining leads to efficiency regardless of the initial allocation of rights. This was a *heuristic device*, not a policy prescription.

**Argument B (the real-world argument):** Transaction costs are *never* zero, so the initial allocation of rights *does* matter. Institutions should be designed to minimize transaction costs. The comparison should be between real-world alternatives, not between a flawed market and an idealized government.

Coase understood externalities as **reciprocal problems** — not "who is causing harm?" but "whose use of a resource should prevail?" He deliberately avoided the term "externality" because he felt it carried a built-in presumption of government intervention.

Coase himself was frustrated by how his work was interpreted — scholars have noted the profession interpreted his article essentially opposite to what he intended, reducing it to a "toy model" of exactly the sort he was criticizing.

### Standard academic critiques

- **Calabresi (1965, 1968):** The theorem doesn't hold in the long run; liability rules *do* affect allocation
- **Polinsky (1983):** Framework breaks down with multiple parties — coordination is the "largest impediment"
- **Hovenkamp (2009):** Much of the theorem was anticipated in Pigou's own work
- **Private information problem:** Bargaining theory shows even two-agent bargains fail with private information
- **Aivazian and Callen (2003):** Formal problems extending the theorem via core theory

### Verdict

**Partially accurate, significantly overstated if used to dismiss externalities entirely.** Coase identified conditions under which externalities resolve privately, while recognizing those conditions frequently don't obtain. Using Coase to argue externalities "aren't real" misrepresents his actual position.

## 2. "All Transactions Affect Third Parties" — Externalities as Non-Distinct

### Key proponents

- **Boudreaux and Meiners (2019),** "Externality: Origins and Classifications," *Natural Resources Journal*, Vol. 59, No. 1, pp. 1–34. Argue the term has "become nearly meaningless due to its ubiquity" and propose only *unexpected* spillovers not already reflected in prices should count.

- **Dahlman (1979),** "The Problem of Externality," *Journal of Law and Economics*, Vol. 22, No. 1, pp. 141–162. Argued that if bargaining costs exceed expected benefits, the externality is "in fact optimal." Invoking ubiquitous externalities "simply constitutes a normative judgement about the role of government."

- **Demsetz (1969),** "Information and Efficiency: Another Viewpoint," *Journal of Law & Economics*, 12:1, pp. 1–22. Introduced the "nirvana fallacy" — comparing real markets to an impossible ideal.

- **Carden and Horwitz (2013):** Externality problems are market "failures" only by comparison to the perfectly competitive model's equilibrium — they fail to live up to a "blackboard ideal."

### Verdict

**Minority position with serious proponents.** Mainstream economics (Pigou, Arrow, Stiglitz, Mankiw) still treats externalities as a distinct category. The weaker claim — that many alleged externalities are already priced in or too loosely defined — has broader acceptance. The stronger claim that the category dissolves entirely is not supported by the profession at large.

## 3. Pollution: Tort Law / Liability vs. Regulation

### The tradition

- **Rothbard (1982),** "Law, Property Rights, and Air Pollution," *Cato Journal*, Vol. 2, No. 1. Pollution is a property rights invasion; 19th-century courts deliberately weakened tort protections to favor industrialization.

- **Block (1998, 2023),** including "Addressing Air Pollution Through Property Rights and Nuisance Law" (*Cosmos + Taxis*, 2023, with Ritter). The state "props up polluters by degrading their nuisance liabilities."

- **Epstein** has also argued for common-law approaches, with more nuance than the Rothbardian position.

### Empirical track record

The evidence is largely **unfavorable to a pure liability-based approach:**

1. **Limited deterrent effect:** Comparative analysis (*Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance*) found tort litigation has had "little deterrent effect on polluter behavior" except for large, isolated point sources
2. **Causation problems:** *Harvard Law Review* documents that proving causation in environmental tort cases is frequently "nearly impossible" — diffuse pollution, latent diseases, cumulative exposures
3. **Information asymmetry:** Victims "do not know what potential environmental injuries they face, where particular harms are coming from, how much those harms affect them"
4. **Insurance dilution:** Liability insurance reduces incentives to avoid harmful conduct
5. **Historical evidence:** Asbestos — industry suppressed safety information for decades; tort litigation existed throughout but didn't prevent harm; a US ban wasn't achieved until 2024

### The Rothbard/Block historical claim

Has *some* historical basis — legal historians document that 19th-century courts did shift toward balancing pollution harms against economic benefits. But this doesn't demonstrate that restoring a pre-industrial tort regime would work for modern diffuse, cumulative pollution (greenhouse gases, microplastics, PFAS).

### Verdict

**Intellectually serious tradition, but empirically weak as a replacement for regulation.** Tort faces structural problems. Most law-and-economics scholars now view tort as a *complement* to regulation, not a substitute.

## 4. Markets Self-Correcting via Information Propagation

### Where it partially works

- **Reputation mechanisms and brand names:** FTC acknowledges these work when consumers can judge quality, firms need repeat purchases, and rivals can enter
- **Private certification:** UL, Consumer Reports, Good Housekeeping
- **Clifford Winston (Brookings, 2006, 2025):** Provides evidence markets sometimes self-correct and government failures may be as costly as market failures — but does *not* argue markets *always* self-correct

### Where markets failed to self-correct

- **Lead paint:** Industry marketed it despite growing evidence of cognitive harm to children. Federal ban required in 1978
- **Asbestos:** Companies suppressed internal documents acknowledging risks. US ban not achieved until 2024
- **Thalidomide:** 10,000+ birth defects before withdrawal. The US was spared thanks to FDA reviewer Frances Kelsey blocking approval — regulation prevented harm the market did not
- **Patent medicines (pre-1906):** Cocaine, morphine, opium without disclosure. After labeling mandated, opiate-containing patent medicine sales decreased ~33%
- **Consumer boycotts:** Friedman study of 90 boycotts (1970–1980) found only 24 completely or partially successful; most required government action or credible regulatory threat

### The structural pattern

Markets self-correct when:
- Quality is easily observable before/after purchase
- Harm is immediate and attributable
- Repeat purchases create reputational incentives
- Alternatives exist with low switching costs

Markets fail to self-correct when:
- Harm is **latent** (years/decades between exposure and disease)
- Causation is **diffuse** (many sources, many victims)
- Producers have **incentives and ability to suppress information**
- Information asymmetry is **structural** (consumers can't evaluate safety even with available data)

### Verdict

**Not supported by the empirical record for credence goods and latent harms.** Markets self-correct well for *experience goods* but fail systematically for *credence goods*, latent harms, and information suppression. The examples commonly cited for market self-correction often depend on an underlying regulatory framework.

## 5. "Most Coordination Failures Trace to Anti-Market Forces"

### Intellectual roots

- **Public Choice Theory (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962):** Government actors are self-interested; rent-seeking and regulatory capture cause government to create or worsen coordination problems. Buchanan called it "politics without romance."
- **Government Failure Literature (Winston, Brookings):** Extensive documentation of government failures. But Winston frames it as government failure being *underappreciated*, not that it explains most coordination failures.
- **Austrian Economics (Rothbard, Block, Mises):** Negative externalities are failures of government to enforce property rights, not market failures. Block argues government *causes* most externalities.
- **Demsetz Nirvana Fallacy (1969):** Three fallacies: "grass is always greener," "free lunch," and "people could be different."

### Verdict

**Recognized minority position, not mainstream.** Associated with Austrian School, Mercatus Center, Cato Institute, parts of Chicago School. Public choice theory has achieved mainstream acceptance for its core insight, but the stronger claim that *most* coordination failures are government-caused is a minority position. Standard economics (Mas-Colell, Varian, Stiglitz) treats externalities, public goods, information asymmetry, and market power as genuine market failures independent of government action.

## Overall Assessment

The decomposition thesis has identifiable intellectual roots and is not fringe, but:

1. **Overstates Coase.** He recognized transaction costs make private bargaining fail frequently
2. **The information half is empirically weak.** Lead, asbestos, thalidomide, patent medicines demonstrate information propagation alone doesn't reliably correct latent and suppressed harms
3. **The coercion half has partial validity but is overgeneralized.** Public choice / government failure analysis is well-established, but the claim that *most* coordination failures are government-caused lacks empirical support
4. **Genuine cases are missed.** Climate change, antibiotic resistance, common-pool resource depletion exist independent of information failures or government coercion. No amount of information propagation solves the free-rider problem in climate policy
5. **It's a recognized minority view** — Austrian/Chicago/law-and-economics niche, not the profession at large
