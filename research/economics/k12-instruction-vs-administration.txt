        K-12 INSTRUCTION VS. ADMINISTRATION SPENDING
        How US Public School Dollars Split Between Instruction,
        Administration, and Support Services
================================================================================

        February 24, 2026  |  Data through FY 2023


KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Instruction's share of current expenditures:         ~60% (steady for decades)
  * Combined administration share (supt + principals):   ~7-8%
  * Fastest-growing per-pupil category (2002-2020):      Pupil support services (+52.7%)
  * Employee benefits growth (2002-2023):                +81.1% per pupil
  * Employee salary growth (2002-2023):                  +7.7% per pupil
  * Non-teaching staff share of all employees (2023):    52.5% (majority since ~2015)
  * Non-teaching staff growth since 1950:                +702%


================================================================================
1. NCES EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES: WHAT COUNTS AS WHAT
================================================================================

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) breaks current expenditures
(day-to-day operating costs, excluding capital outlay and debt service) into
these functional categories:

INSTRUCTION (~60% of current expenditures)
  Salaries and benefits for teachers, textbooks, supplies, and purchased
  instructional services. This is classroom-level spending.

SUPPORT SERVICES (~35-36% of current expenditures)
  An umbrella category with seven subfunctions:

  Subfunction                 What It Covers
  --------------------------  -----------------------------------------------
  Student support services    Guidance counselors, health services, attendance
                              officers, social workers, psychologists, speech
                              pathologists
  Instructional staff support Curriculum development, staff training,
                              libraries, media centers, computer centers
  General administration      School board (board of education),
                              superintendent's office, and their immediate
                              central-office staff -- district-level governance
  School administration       Principal's office -- principals, assistant
                              principals, and their building-level office staff
  Operations and maintenance  Building services (HVAC, custodial), security,
                              grounds, equipment upkeep
  Student transportation      Bus operations, vehicle maintenance
  Other support services      Business support (fiscal operations), central
                              support (planning, research, evaluation, data
                              processing, HR, warehousing)

OTHER CURRENT EXPENDITURES (~4-5%)
  Food services, enterprise operations, community services.

KEY DEFINITIONAL POINT:
  When NCES reports aggregate "administration expenditures," it typically
  combines general administration + school administration + other support
  services (which includes business and central support). This is broader
  than what most people picture when they hear "administration." The narrow
  categories -- general administration (superintendent/board) and school
  administration (principals) -- are much smaller.

2. EXPENDITURE BREAKDOWN BY FUNCTION: THE NUMBERS
================================================================================

FY 2022 Percentage Breakdown (NCES CCD, most recent full data)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Instruction            [============================================================] 59.5%
  Ops & Maintenance      [=========] 9.3%
  Student Support        [=======] 6.7%
  School Admin (princ.)  [======] 5.6%
  Instr. Staff Support   [=====] 5.0% (est.)
  Food Services          [=====] ~4-5%
  Transportation         [====] ~4.0% (est.)
  Other Support          [====] ~3-4%
  General Admin (supt.)  [==] ~2.0% (est.)

  "General Admin" = superintendent/board. "School Admin" = principals.
  Combined administration is ~7-8% of current expenditures.
  Instruction has held steady at 60-61% for decades.

  FY 2022 absolute totals:
    Salaries & wages:     $416.7 billion
    Employee benefits:    $178.3 billion
    Combined:             $595.0 billion  (77.5% of current expenditures)
    Instruction + instr. staff support:  $497.1 billion  (64.7%)


Per-Pupil Amounts by Function (2010-11 to 2020-21, NCES, Constant 2022-23 $)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Category                          2010-11      2020-21      Change

  Total current expenditures/pupil  $14,453      $16,280      +13%
  Instruction per pupil             $8,841       $9,885       +12%
  Support services per pupil        $5,023       $5,878       +17%

  Instruction consistently accounted for 60-61% of current expenditures
  throughout the decade. Support services accounted for 35-36%.

  Employee salaries (all cats.)     $8,449/pp    $9,098/pp    +7.7% (2002-2023)


CRITICAL INSIGHT:
  Spending increases between 2002 and 2020 were NOT disproportionately
  absorbed by administration:
    - School admin (principals):           +20.5%
    - General admin (superintendent/board): +18.3%
    - Instruction:                          +19.9%

  These growth rates are roughly comparable. The OUTLIER is pupil support
  services (+52.7%), driven by mandated services: psychological, guidance,
  health care, paraprofessional services for students with disabilities
  (speech pathology, occupational therapy).

  KEY RATIO: For every $1 added to salaries, $3.27 went to benefits.

  --------------------------------------  --------  ---------  ----------
  Student enrollment                      --        --         +4.1%
  Total staff                             --        --         +15.1%

  Non-teaching staff                      --        --         +22.8%
  Non-teaching share of all employees     49.2%     52.5%      +3.3 pp

  Non-teaching staff (counselors, social workers, speech pathologists,
  instructional aides, etc.) now make up OVER HALF of all public school
  employees.


Post-COVID Staffing Surge (2020-2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Despite enrollment FALLING by 1.18 million students between 2020 and 2023,
  public schools ADDED 81,000+ non-teaching staff. State examples:

  * California:  lost 318,532 students; added 3,400 non-teaching staff
  * New York:    lost 159,701 students; added 6,996 non-teaching staff


AEI / Heritage Foundation Long-Run Data (1950-2017)

  1992-2009       +17%         --         +46% (admin+non-t.)  --

  By 2010: 3.099M teachers and 3.096M non-teaching staff -- essentially
  1:1 parity. By 2015, non-teaching staff outnumbered teachers for the
  first time. By 2023, the ratio was 52.5% non-teaching to 47.5% teaching.

  ~2000      ~52%
  ~2010      ~50%
  2023       47.5%

  The decline is consistent: teachers have gone from roughly two-thirds
  of school employees to less than half over 70 years.

  1955           ~27:1                  --
  1970           ~22.3:1                --
  2001           15.9:1                 --

  2031 (proj.)   14.7:1                 10.1:1

  The pupil-to-teacher ratio decreased 30% from ~23:1 in 1970 to below
  16:1 by 2017. It has been essentially FLAT for the past 20 years,
  hovering between 15.4 and 16.0.

  Post-COVID: 43 out of 51 states/jurisdictions saw student-teacher
  ratios DECREASE between 2018-19 and 2022-23 (fewer students per teacher).


Student-to-Administrator/Staff Ratios
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Year       Students per District Admin    Source
  ------     ----------------------------   -----------
  2000       816:1                          NCES CCD
  2022       559.9:1                        NCES CCD

  This represents a 31.4% DECLINE in the student-to-district-administrator
  ratio -- meaning each administrator now serves far fewer students.

  In 2023: approximately 993,000 school administrators in the US, including
  512,000 principals and other administrators at elementary and secondary
  schools. This is a 4% increase from 2018 and a 23.5% increase from 2013.


The AASA Counterargument
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The American Association of School Administrators (AASA) offers a
  different framing:

  * The ratio of central-office staff to teachers was 32.4:1 in 1992-93
    and 33:1 in 2002-03 -- essentially unchanged

  * Public schools have a staff-to-administrator ratio of roughly 13:1,
    compared to 3.3:1 in public administration generally, suggesting
    schools are LESS top-heavy than government overall

  * AASA argues that when all central-office administrative and professional
    staff are included, there has been "no significant increase" in
    administrators relative to teachers

================================================================================
5. WHAT ACTUALLY DRIVES COST INCREASES: CLAIMS VS. DATA
================================================================================

The "Administrative Bloat" Claim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The popular narrative: schools have hired armies of administrators while
  neglecting classrooms, and this is the primary driver of rising per-pupil
  costs.

  WHAT THE STAFFING DATA SHOWS:
    There has been genuine, dramatic growth in non-teaching staff -- up
    702% since 1950 vs. 96% for enrollment. District administrative staff
    specifically grew 74.9% from 2000-2017 vs. 7.7% for teachers.
    Non-teaching staff now outnumber teachers.

  WHAT THE SPENDING DATA SHOWS:
    Administration spending (narrowly defined) has grown at roughly the same
    rate as instruction spending -- about 18-20% in real per-pupil terms
    from 2002 to 2020. Administration remains a relatively small share:
      - General admin (superintendent/board):  ~2% of current exp. (~$265/pp)
      - School admin (principals):             ~5.6% of current exp. (~$758/pp)
      - Combined:                              ~7-8% of current expenditures


The FEE/Tabarrok Counterpoint
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Alex Tabarrok (George Mason, via FEE) argues the bloat narrative is
  overstated:

  * Principals and administrators number only 0.4 per 100 students --
    a figure that barely changed from 1950 to 2015

  * "A bloated little toe cannot explain a 20-pound weight gain"

  * The real explanation: we hired more teachers (the student-teacher ratio
    halved from ~27:1 to ~15:1) and pay them more in real terms

  * The administrator increase was largely complete by 1980, but
    expenditures kept growing

                                            Pension debt is primary culprit.

                                            relative to enrollment. Tabarrok
                                            identifies this as the primary
                                            historical cost driver.

                                            (~18-20%) roughly matches instruction.

                                            2000-2017) is real but on a small base.
                                            DeAngelis & Makridis (2025) find growth
                                            more pronounced in states with stronger
                                            teachers' union influence.


THE NUANCED PICTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The data suggests a synthesis:

  1. Non-teaching staff have genuinely proliferated -- the 702% growth
     since 1950 is not in dispute.

  2. But most of those aren't "administrators" in the popular sense --
     they're counselors, social workers, speech pathologists, instructional
     aides, health staff, and technology support.

  3. Many of these roles are legally mandated -- IDEA, Section 504, state
     mental health requirements, and other mandates drive much of the
     "support services" growth.

  4. The spending data does not show administration taking an ever-larger
     share -- instruction's share has held steady at 60-61%, and
     administration's share hasn't meaningfully grown.

  5. The real cost story is benefits and mandated services -- pension/health
     costs up 81%, pupil support up 53%, while salaries are nearly flat.

  6. Teacher pay has actually declined in real terms (-6.1%, 2002-2022)
     even as total spending per pupil rose 36%.

  BOTTOM LINE: The "administrative bloat" narrative is PARTIALLY TRUE, MOSTLY
  MISLEADING. Non-teaching staff have genuinely proliferated (+702% since
  1950), but most are counselors, social workers, speech pathologists, and
  instructional aides -- many legally mandated. Administration's share of
  spending has not meaningfully grown. The dominant cost drivers are benefits,
  mandated support services, and staffing growth that outpaces enrollment.

  Mean literacy proficiency trend         Decreased     --            All age
                                          (2012-2023)                 groups

  Part of the US spending "lead" comes from ancillary services (athletics,
  student housing) that other countries don't fund at comparable levels.

  Despite high investment, US adult literacy scores are at the OECD average
  (28% at Level 1 or below), and mean literacy proficiency DECREASED across
  all age groups between 2012 and 2023.
