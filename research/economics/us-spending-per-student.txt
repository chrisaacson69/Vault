        US REAL SPENDING PER STUDENT OVER TIME
        Inflation-Adjusted K-12 Per-Pupil Expenditure
        Verified Across Nine Independent Sources
================================================================================

        February 24, 2026  |  Data through FY 2023


KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Real increase since 1960:                ~3-4x
  * Per student in 2023 (2023 dollars):      $20,322
  * Inflation-adjusted growth, 1960-2019:    +280%
  * US spending vs. OECD average (K-12):     +38%


================================================================================
1. PER-PUPIL SPENDING OVER TIME
================================================================================

Real (inflation-adjusted) spending per student in US public K-12 schools has
risen dramatically over six decades. Nine independent data sources -- spanning
federal agencies, international organizations, and think tanks across the
political spectrum -- all confirm the same basic trajectory: a roughly three-
to four-fold increase in constant dollars since 1960.

Spending by Year (Constant 2022-23 Dollars, NCES / Statista)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ~1960     |  $4,060   |  ****
  1990      |  $12,206  |  ************
  2002      |  $14,969  |  ***************
  2010-11   |  $14,453  |  **************
  2012-13   |  $13,952  |  **************  <- post-recession low
  2020-21   |  $16,280  |  ****************
  2023      |  $20,322  |  ********************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Each * represents roughly $1,000 in spending per student.

  All others from NCES/Statista (2022-23 dollars).


Real Growth by Decade

2. WHO PAYS: LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL SHARES
================================================================================

All per-pupil figures combine every funding source. The mix has shifted
dramatically over the past century -- from an almost entirely local system
to a roughly even state/local split, with a small but volatile federal
component.

Revenue Shares by Decade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Year     Local   State   Federal   Context
  ------   -----   -----   -------   -----------------------------------------
  ~1920    83%     17%     <1%       Almost entirely local property taxes
  ~1970    52%     40%      8%       Local still dominant
  ~1980    43%     47%     10%       States take the lead (equity lawsuits)
  ~1990    47%     47%      6%       Federal at modern low
  ~2000    45%     47%      8%       Roughly stable split
  ~2010    44%     44%     12%       Federal peaks (ARRA stimulus)
  ~2020    44%     46%     11%       COVID relief inflates federal share
  FY 2023  42%     45%     13%       ESSER funds winding down

  Visual (FY 2023):
  Local   [==========================================] 42%
  State   [=============================================] 45%
  Federal [=============] 13%


FY 2022 in Absolute Dollars (NCES CCD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total revenues per pupil:     $18,461

  State:      $383.9 billion    (43.7%)
  Local:      $375.2 billion    (42.7%)  -- primarily property taxes
  Federal:    $119.1 billion    (13.6%)


Historical Shift
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest structural change is the century-long transfer from local to state:

  - Early 1900s: local property taxes funded ~83% of schools
  - 1970s-80s:   states overtook local as the largest source
  - Driver:      school finance equity lawsuits (Serrano v. Priest, 1971)

Federal share is historically small (6-13%), spiking only during emergencies:
  - 2009-10:  peaked ~13% (ARRA recession stimulus)
  - 2020-22:  peaked ~14% (CARES/CRRSA/ARP COVID relief, $190B in ESSER)
  - Now returning toward the historical ~8-9% baseline

3. WHERE THE MONEY GOES (2002-2023)
================================================================================

Between 2002 and 2023, benefits -- not salaries -- drove cost growth.

  Category                  2002        2022-23     Change
  -----------------------   ---------   ---------   -----------
  Benefits per student      $2,221      $4,022      +81.1%
  Salaries per student      $8,449      $9,098      +7.7%
  Average teacher salary    $75,152     $70,548     -6.1%

  Staff count growth:       +15.1%      (vs. enrollment growth of only +4.1%)
  Non-teaching staff:       +22.8%

  KEY RATIO: For every $1 added to salaries, $3.27 went to benefits.

  All figures inflation-adjusted.

4. INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT (OECD, 2019-2022)
================================================================================

  Measure                           US          OECD Avg    Difference
  --------------------------------  ----------  ----------  ----------
  K-12 per FTE student (2019)       $15,500     $11,300     +38%
  Postsecondary per FTE student     $37,400     $18,400     +103%
  Education as % of GDP             5.8%        4.7%        +1.1 pp

  The US ranks 3rd-5th highest per student among OECD nations.

================================================================================
5. METHODOLOGICAL NOTE
================================================================================

Most sources use the CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) to
adjust for inflation. The Economic Policy Institute raises a valid concern:

  - ~80% of education spending is labor costs (salaries + benefits)
  - Education labor costs may rise faster than general consumer prices
  - The CPI-U may therefore OVERSTATE real spending growth
  - A services-specific deflator yields lower but still substantial growth
    (61% from 1967-1991 vs. the commonly cited "doubled")

Regardless of deflator choice, the directional finding is robust across all
nine sources: real per-pupil spending has increased enormously.


================================================================================
6. KEY TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================

  1. TREND IS UNAMBIGUOUS: Real per-pupil spending has risen roughly 3-4x
     since 1960 in constant dollars.

  2. GROWTH HAS SLOWED: The 1960s saw ~58% real growth; recent decades
     are in single digits per decade.

  3. BENEFITS DRIVE COSTS: Pensions and health insurance absorbed the
     lion's share of spending increases since 2002, not teacher pay.

  4. TOP GLOBAL SPENDER: The US spends 38% above the OECD average at
     K-12, and double at postsecondary.

  5. LOCAL-TO-STATE SHIFT: Property taxes once funded 83% of schools;
     now it's a roughly even state/local split.

  6. FEDERAL SHARE IS SMALL BUT VOLATILE: 6-14%, spiking only during
     recessions and emergencies (ARRA, COVID ESSER).
