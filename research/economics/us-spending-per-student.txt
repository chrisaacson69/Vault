        US REAL SPENDING PER STUDENT OVER TIME
        Inflation-Adjusted K-12 Per-Pupil Expenditure
        Verified Across Nine Independent Sources
================================================================================

        February 24, 2026  |  Data through FY 2023


KEY FINDINGS AT A GLANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Real increase since 1960:                ~3-4x
  * Per student in 2023 (2023 dollars):      $20,322
  * Inflation-adjusted growth, 1960-2019:    +280%
  * US spending vs. OECD average (K-12):     +38%


================================================================================
1. PER-PUPIL SPENDING OVER TIME
================================================================================

Real (inflation-adjusted) spending per student in US public K-12 schools has
risen dramatically over six decades. Nine independent data sources -- spanning
federal agencies, international organizations, and think tanks across the
political spectrum -- all confirm the same basic trajectory: a roughly three-
to four-fold increase in constant dollars since 1960.

Spending by Year (Constant 2022-23 Dollars, NCES / Statista)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ~1960     |  $4,060   |  ****
  1990      |  $12,206  |  ************
  2002      |  $14,969  |  ***************
  2010-11   |  $14,453  |  **************
  2012-13   |  $13,952  |  **************  <- post-recession low
  2020-21   |  $16,280  |  ****************
  2023      |  $20,322  |  ********************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Each * represents roughly $1,000 in spending per student.

2. WHO PAYS: LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL SHARES
================================================================================

All per-pupil figures combine every funding source. The mix has shifted
dramatically over the past century -- from an almost entirely local system
to a roughly even state/local split, with a small but volatile federal
component.

Revenue Shares by Decade
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Year     Local   State   Federal   Context
  ------   -----   -----   -------   -----------------------------------------
  ~1920    83%     17%     <1%       Almost entirely local property taxes
  ~1970    52%     40%      8%       Local still dominant
  ~1980    43%     47%     10%       States take the lead (equity lawsuits)
  ~1990    47%     47%      6%       Federal at modern low
  ~2000    45%     47%      8%       Roughly stable split
  ~2010    44%     44%     12%       Federal peaks (ARRA stimulus)
  ~2020    44%     46%     11%       COVID relief inflates federal share
  FY 2023  42%     45%     13%       ESSER funds winding down

  Visual (FY 2023):
  Local   [==========================================] 42%
  State   [=============================================] 45%
  Federal [=============] 13%


FY 2022 in Absolute Dollars (NCES CCD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total revenues per pupil:     $18,461

  State:      $383.9 billion    (43.7%)
  Local:      $375.2 billion    (42.7%)  -- primarily property taxes
  Federal:    $119.1 billion    (13.6%)


Historical Shift
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest structural change is the century-long transfer from local to state:

  - Early 1900s: local property taxes funded ~83% of schools
  - 1970s-80s:   states overtook local as the largest source
  - Driver:      school finance equity lawsuits (Serrano v. Priest, 1971)

Federal share is historically small (6-13%), spiking only during emergencies:
  - 2009-10:  peaked ~13% (ARRA recession stimulus)
  - 2020-22:  peaked ~14% (CARES/CRRSA/ARP COVID relief, $190B in ESSER)
  - Now returning toward the historical ~8-9% baseline

3. WHERE THE MONEY GOES (2002-2023)
================================================================================

Between 2002 and 2023, benefits -- not salaries -- drove cost growth.

  Category                  2002        2022-23     Change
  -----------------------   ---------   ---------   -----------
  Benefits per student      $2,221      $4,022      +81.1%
  Salaries per student      $8,449      $9,098      +7.7%
  Average teacher salary    $75,152     $70,548     -6.1%

  Staff count growth:       +15.1%      (vs. enrollment growth of only +4.1%)
  Non-teaching staff:       +22.8%

  KEY RATIO: For every $1 added to salaries, $3.27 went to benefits.

  All figures inflation-adjusted.

================================================================================
4. INSTRUCTION VS. ADMINISTRATION: THE "BLOAT" QUESTION
================================================================================

A common claim is that "administrative bloat" is the primary driver of rising
costs. The data tells a more nuanced story.

How the Dollar Breaks Down (FY 2022, % of Current Expenditures)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Instruction            [============================================================] 59.5%
  Ops & Maintenance      [=========] 9.3%
  Student Support        [=======] 6.7%
  School Admin (princ.)  [======] 5.6%
  Instr. Staff Support   [=====] 5.0%
  Food Services          [=====] ~4.5%
  Transportation         [====] ~4%
  General Admin (supt.)  [==] ~2%

  "General Admin" = superintendent/board. "School Admin" = principals.
  Combined administration is ~7-8% of current expenditures.
  Instruction has held steady at 60-61% for decades.
  Source: NCES CCD FY 2022.


Per-Pupil Growth by Function (2002-2020, Constant Dollars)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Category                      2002        2020        Change
  ----------------------------  ---------   ---------   -----------
  Instruction                   $6,818      $8,176      +19.9%
  School admin (principals)     $629        $758        +20.5%
  General admin (supt/board)    $224        $265        +18.3%
  PUPIL SUPPORT SERVICES        $566        $864        +52.7%  <<<

  Administration grew at roughly the same rate as instruction (~18-20%).
  The real outlier is PUPIL SUPPORT SERVICES (+52.7%), driven by mandated
  special education, counseling, psychology, and health services.

Staffing: Teachers vs. Everyone Else
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Since 1950:  enrollment +96%, teachers +252%, non-teaching staff +702%
  Since 2002:  enrollment +4.1%, teachers +7.6%, non-teaching staff +22.8%
  District admin (2000-2017):   +74.9% vs. teachers +7.7%

  Non-teaching staff now = 52.5% of all school employees (majority since ~2015).

  Year       Teachers as % of Staff    Student-to-Teacher Ratio
  ------     ----------------------    ------------------------
  ~1950      ~70%                      ~27:1
  ~1970      ~60%                      ~22:1
  ~2000      ~52%                      15.9:1
  ~2010      ~50%                      15.4:1
  2023       47.5%                     15.4:1

What's Actually Driving Costs (Ranked by Magnitude)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #  Driver                                Impact
  --  ------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------
  1.  Employee benefits (pensions, health)  +81.1%/pupil. $3.27 in benefits per $1
                                            in salary increases.
  2.  Pupil support / special ed mandates   +52.7%/pupil. Spec. ed. = $13,127/student;
                                            IDEA covers only ~12%.
  3.  Staffing growth beyond enrollment     +15.1% staff for +4.1% students.
                                            Est. $24.3B/yr excess (Friedman Fdn).
  4.  Class size reduction                  Ratio halved from ~27:1 to ~15:1,
                                            roughly doubling teacher workforce.
  5.  Administration (narrow)               ~7-8% of spending. Growth rate (~18-20%)
                                            roughly matches instruction.

  BOTTOM LINE: The "administrative bloat" narrative is PARTIALLY TRUE, MOSTLY
  MISLEADING. Non-teaching staff have genuinely proliferated (+702% since 1950),
  but most are counselors, social workers, speech pathologists, and instructional
  aides -- many legally mandated. Administration's share of spending has not
  meaningfully grown. The dominant cost drivers are benefits, mandated support
  services, and staffing growth that outpaces enrollment.

5. INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT (OECD, 2019-2022)
================================================================================

  Measure                           US          OECD Avg    Difference
  --------------------------------  ----------  ----------  ----------
  K-12 per FTE student (2019)       $15,500     $11,300     +38%
  Postsecondary per FTE student     $37,400     $18,400     +103%
  Education as % of GDP             5.8%        4.7%        +1.1 pp

  The US ranks 3rd-5th highest per student among OECD nations.

================================================================================
6. METHODOLOGICAL NOTE
================================================================================

Most sources use the CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) to
adjust for inflation. The Economic Policy Institute raises a valid concern:

  - ~80% of education spending is labor costs (salaries + benefits)
  - Education labor costs may rise faster than general consumer prices
  - The CPI-U may therefore OVERSTATE real spending growth
  - A services-specific deflator yields lower but still substantial growth
    (61% from 1967-1991 vs. the commonly cited "doubled")

Regardless of deflator choice, the directional finding is robust across all
nine sources: real per-pupil spending has increased enormously.


================================================================================
7. KEY TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================

  1. TREND IS UNAMBIGUOUS: Real per-pupil spending has risen roughly 3-4x
     since 1960 in constant dollars.

  2. GROWTH HAS SLOWED: The 1960s saw ~58% real growth; recent decades
     are in single digits per decade.

  3. BENEFITS DRIVE COSTS: Pensions and health insurance absorbed the
     lion's share of spending increases since 2002, not teacher pay.

  4. "ADMIN BLOAT" IS REAL BUT OVERSTATED: Non-teaching staff are up
     702% since 1950, but most are mandated support roles, not
     administrators. Administration's ~7-8% share hasn't grown.

  5. TOP GLOBAL SPENDER: The US spends 38% above the OECD average at
     K-12, and double at postsecondary.

  6. LOCAL-TO-STATE SHIFT: Property taxes once funded 83% of schools;
     now it's a roughly even state/local split.

  7. FEDERAL SHARE IS SMALL BUT VOLATILE: 6-14%, spiking only during
     recessions and emergencies (ARRA, COVID ESSER).
