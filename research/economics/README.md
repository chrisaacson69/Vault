> A major area of interest — understanding how value, trade, and systems of exchange work.

## Why This Matters
Economics is foundational to understanding how AI agents interact with the real world. If an AI is going to run a business, manage resources, or make decisions that involve trade-offs, it needs to understand the principles that govern exchange — not just the accounting, but the theory underneath.

The [Claudius vending machine experiment](../claude-opus-4-6.md) is a concrete example: the AI failed not because it couldn't do math, but because it had no model of value, utility, or why profit exists.

## Sub-Topics

### Fundamentals
- [Value and Profit](./value-and-profit.md) — utility theory, mutual benefit, and why profit emerges from trade
- [Risk and Entrepreneurship](./risk-and-entrepreneurship.md) — uncertainty, time preference, and why profit is the reward for correct bets

### Praxis
- [Agent Teams vs. the Theory](./praxis-agent-teams.md) — testing the framework against real Opus 4.6 deployments

### Planned
- Business Models — how value is captured and sustained
- Architecture & Guardrails — how system design protects the profit signal (bridges to AI agent architecture)
- Agent Team Economics — compute costs vs. value created, optimal team structures
