## The Core Thesis

**The market always gives society exactly what they want within the constraints of what is possible.**

This is not a defense of outcomes. It's a structural claim about the mechanism. The market is a distributed computation engine that solves supply and demand simultaneously through the price signal. It processes information as fast as reality allows. What economists call "market failures" are mostly just information that hasn't propagated yet — and any intervention assumes the intervener has better information than the distributed market, which is almost always wrong (Hayek's knowledge problem).

## What the Market Actually Responds To

The market responds to *effective demand* — want backed by purchasing power. Dollar-weighted demand is not a flaw; it's the signal. The weighting *is* the information. Those who generate more value for others accumulate more purchasing power, which gives their preferences more weight in future allocation. This is a feature of the mechanism, not a bug.

**The teacher example:** We say we want better teachers. We pay for nicer clothes. The market believes the credit card, not the survey. Revealed preference is the only honest measure of what people actually value. The uncomfortable truth is that the market is *right* to believe the credit card — that's the revealed truth about what people value at the margin.

But: a person who puts their own money into private school is sending the correct market signal — public education isn't delivering value proportional to cost. And then they rightly get angry at the ~$20k per student the government spends on their behalf in a system they've already rejected with their wallet. They can't opt out. They can't redirect. The market signal is being drowned out by compulsory revenue collection. Full enrollment in public schools isn't demand — it's a captive audience.

## Economists Must Look at Both Sides

A persistent failure in economic analysis is evaluating only supply *or* demand, never both simultaneously. The market never makes this error — price *is* the intersection of both sides. But humans analyzing the market constantly isolate one variable and tell a story about it.

**The immigration example:** Most economists say immigration is good because GDP goes up. This only looks at the supply side. Immigrant workers also put demand on the economy — they buy things, use services, occupy housing. More demand and more supply is not automatically better.

The fix is simple: **GDP per capita** — the economist's own definition of standard of living. If an immigrant contributes more than this measure, they are increasing the standard of living (GDP/cap goes up). If they don't, they are decreasing it. The market, absent coercive distortions, would naturally select for the first type — employers would recruit productive workers because it's profitable. Immigration policy that substitutes political criteria for economic ones is itself an anti-market force.

The pattern repeats everywhere:
- "Housing starts are up!" — Supply. What about demand pressure?
- "Wages are rising!" — Supply of money to workers. What about inflation eating those gains?
- "We created 300,000 jobs!" — Supply of employment. At what productivity? Above or below per-capita contribution?

The market is a simultaneous equation solver. Humans are narrative thinkers. We do one side at a time and often stop before we get to the other.

## Where the Market Fails

Two categories, both real:

### 1. Coercive Forces Outside the Market

Government price controls, subsidies, tariffs, monopoly grants, regulatory capture. These distort the price signal the market needs to function. The market can't give society what it wants if the information mechanism is being overridden. This is straightforward and widely acknowledged (if not widely acted upon).

### 2. Human Information Processing Limits

**It is possible humans are not smart enough to live in a free market.**

The market is a perfect machine that requires an imperfect operator. The theory works — but it requires participants who can:
- Process complex information
- Evaluate tradeoffs across multiple dimensions
- Resist manipulation
- Think long-term
- Act on their actual interests

Humans often can't. This is the 99-problems / Chesterton's fence issue. Modern society buries so much complexity that consumers can't make good choices. They end up relying on outside forces — media, brands, political tribes, experts — to do their thinking. And those outside forces have their own incentives, which are often anti-market.

The failure cascade:
1. Modern complexity overwhelms human information processing capacity
2. Humans outsource their thinking to institutions and intermediaries
3. Those intermediaries have their own incentive structures
4. Those incentives are often misaligned with market efficiency
5. The outsourced decisions corrupt the inputs to the market
6. The market faithfully processes corrupted inputs
7. Outcomes look like "market failure" but are actually *input failure*

Even the professional class trained to understand markets — economists — fails this test. They analyze one side of the ledger and call it analysis. If the experts can't process both supply and demand simultaneously, the average consumer has no chance.

**The market doesn't fail. The participants fail the market.** And the gap between what the market requires of us and what we're capable of — that gap is where every problem lives.

## What to Do About It

The tempting answer is intervention — regulation, mandates, expert panels. But this runs headfirst into Hayek's knowledge problem: the interveners know less than the distributed market, and they have their own incentive distortions.

The better answer, though it falls flat in practice: **be a better consumer. Learn how to negotiate.** The market rewards informed participants. The difficulty is that this advice requires exactly the information processing capacity that most people lack.

This is an open problem. The mechanism is sound. The inputs are corrupted. And the corruption is partially structural (complexity) and partially self-inflicted (outsourced thinking).
