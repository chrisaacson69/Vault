## 1. NCES Expenditure Categories: What Counts as What

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) breaks **current expenditures** (day-to-day operating costs, excluding capital outlay and debt service) into these functional categories:

### Instruction (~60% of current expenditures)
Salaries and benefits for teachers, textbooks, supplies, and purchased instructional services. This is classroom-level spending.

### Support Services (~35-36% of current expenditures)
An umbrella category with **seven subfunctions**:

| Subfunction | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| **Student support services** | Guidance counselors, health services, attendance officers, social workers, psychologists, speech pathologists |
| **Instructional staff support** | Curriculum development, staff training, libraries, media centers, computer centers |
| **General administration** | School board (board of education), superintendent's office, and their immediate central-office staff — **district-level governance** |
| **School administration** | Principal's office — principals, assistant principals, and their building-level office staff |
| **Operations and maintenance** | Building services (HVAC, custodial), security, grounds, equipment upkeep |
| **Student transportation** | Bus operations, vehicle maintenance |
| **Other support services** | Business support (fiscal operations), central support (planning, research, evaluation, data processing, HR, warehousing) |

### Other Current Expenditures (~4-5%)
Food services, enterprise operations, community services.

### Key Definitional Point
When NCES reports aggregate "administration expenditures," it typically combines **general administration + school administration + other support services** (which includes business and central support). This is broader than what most people picture when they hear "administration." The narrow categories — general administration (superintendent/board) and school administration (principals) — are much smaller.

## 2. Expenditure Breakdown by Function: The Numbers

### FY 2022 Percentage Breakdown (NCES CCD, most recent full data)

| Function | % of Current Expenditures |
|---|---|
| **Instruction** | 59.5% |
| Operations and maintenance | 9.3% |
| Student support services | 6.7% |
| **School administration** | 5.6% |
| Instructional staff support | 5.0% (est.) |
| Student transportation | 4.0% (est.) |
| **General administration** | 2.0% (est.) |
| Other support services | ~3-4% |
| Food services | ~4-5% |

In FY 2022, salaries and wages totaled $416.7 billion and employee benefits totaled $178.3 billion, together accounting for **77.5%** ($595.0 billion) of current expenditures.

Instruction and instructional staff support together comprised **64.7%** ($497.1 billion) of total current expenditures.

### Per-Pupil Amounts by Function (Constant Dollars)

**2010-11 to 2020-21 (NCES, constant 2022-23 dollars):**

| Category | 2010-11 | 2020-21 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Total current expenditures per pupil** | $14,453 | $16,280 | +13% |
| Instruction per pupil | $8,841 | $9,885 | +12% |
| Support services per pupil | $5,023 | $5,878 | +17% |

Instruction consistently accounted for **60-61%** of current expenditures throughout the decade. Support services accounted for **35-36%**.

### Reason Foundation Crossroads Report (2002-2020, Constant Dollars)

The Reason Foundation's "Public Education at a Crossroads" report provides the most granular historical per-pupil breakdown available:

| Category | 2002 | 2020 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Instruction** | $6,818/pupil | $8,176/pupil | +$1,358 (+19.9%) |
| — of which: salaries | — | — | +$226/pupil |
| — of which: benefits | — | — | +$995/pupil |
| **School administration** (principals) | $629/pupil | $758/pupil | +$129 (+20.5%) |
| **General administration** (supt/board) | $224/pupil | $265/pupil | +$41 (+18.3%) |
| **Pupil support services** | $566/pupil | $864/pupil | +$298 (+52.7%) |
| **Support services (total)** | — | — | +$974/pupil (+25.4%) |
| **Employee benefits (all categories)** | $2,221/pupil | — | — |
| **Employee benefits (2023)** | — | $4,022/pupil | **+81.1%** (2002-2023) |
| **Employee salaries (all categories)** | $8,449/pupil | $9,098/pupil | +7.7% (2002-2023) |

### Critical Insight from the Reason Data

Spending increases between 2002 and 2020 **were not disproportionately absorbed by administration**:
- School administration (principals): $629 to $758/pupil (+20.5%)
- General administration (superintendent/board): $224 to $265/pupil (+18.3%)
- Instruction: $6,818 to $8,176/pupil (+19.9%)

These growth rates are roughly comparable. The **outlier** is pupil support services ($566 to $864, +52.7%), driven by mandated services including psychological, guidance, health care, paraprofessional services for students with disabilities (speech pathology, occupational therapy).

The single biggest driver of cost increases was **employee benefits**: up 81.1% per pupil from 2002 to 2023, versus only 7.7% for salaries. Benefits (pensions, health insurance) consumed $3.27 for every $1 added to salaries.

## 3. Staffing Trends: Teachers vs. Non-Teaching Staff

### Reason Foundation 2025 Spotlight (2002-2023)

| Metric | 2002 | 2023 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Student enrollment | — | — | **+4.1%** |
| Total staff | — | — | **+15.1%** |
| Teachers | — | — | **+7.6%** |
| Non-teaching staff | — | — | **+22.8%** |
| Non-teaching share of all employees | 49.2% | 52.5% | +3.3 pp |

Non-teaching staff (counselors, social workers, speech pathologists, instructional aides, etc.) now make up **over half** of all public school employees.

### Post-COVID Staffing Surge (2020-2023)

Despite enrollment **falling by 1.18 million students** between 2020 and 2023, public schools **added 81,000+ non-teaching staff**. State examples:
- **California:** lost 318,532 students; added 3,400 non-teaching staff
- **New York:** lost 159,701 students; added 6,996 non-teaching staff

### AEI / Heritage Foundation Long-Run Data (1950-2017)

| Period | Enrollment | Teachers | Non-Teaching Staff | All Staff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1950-2017 | +96% | +252% | **+702%** | — |
| 1970-2010 | +7.8% | +60% | **+138%** | +84% |
| 1992-2009 | +17% | — | **+46%** (admin + non-teaching) | — |

By 2010, there were 3.099 million teachers and 3.096 million non-teaching staff — essentially **1:1 parity**. By 2015, non-teaching staff outnumbered teachers for the first time. By 2023, the ratio was 52.5% non-teaching to 47.5% teaching.

### Education Next Data (2000-2017)

| Category | 2000-2017 Change |
|---|---|
| Principals and assistant principals | **+33.4%** |
| District administrative staff | **+74.9%** |
| Teachers | +7.7% |
| Student enrollment | +10% |

Bureau of Labor Statistics (1999-2019): K-12 "education administrators" grew **45.5%** (to ~271,000), while teachers grew only **5.4%**.

### Friedman Foundation / Heritage (1970-2010)

Teachers as a percentage of all school staff:
- **1950:** ~70% (estimate)
- **1970:** ~60%
- **2000:** ~52%
- **2010:** ~50%
- **2023:** ~47.5%

The decline is consistent: teachers have gone from roughly two-thirds of school employees to less than half over 70 years.

## 4. Student-to-Teacher and Student-to-Administrator Ratios

### Student-to-Teacher Ratio (NCES)

| Year | Public School Ratio | Private School Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| 1955 | ~27:1 | — |
| 1970 | ~22.3:1 | — |
| 2001 | 15.9:1 | — |
| 2008 | 15.4:1 | 12.8:1 |
| 2018-19 | 16.0:1 | — |
| 2020 | 15.9:1 | 12.5:1 |
| 2022-23 | **15.4:1** | — |
| 2031 (proj.) | 14.7:1 | 10.1:1 |

The pupil-to-teacher ratio **decreased 30%** from ~23:1 in 1970 to below 16:1 by 2017. It has been essentially **flat for the past 20 years**, hovering between 15.4 and 16.0.

Post-COVID: 43 out of 51 states/jurisdictions saw student-teacher ratios **decrease** between 2018-19 and 2022-23 (fewer students per teacher).

### Student-to-Administrator/Staff Ratios

| Year | Students per District Administrator | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2000 | 816:1 | NCES CCD |
| 2022 | **559.9:1** | NCES CCD |

This represents a **31.4% decline** in the student-to-district-administrator ratio — meaning each administrator now serves far fewer students.

In 2023, there were approximately **993,000 school administrators** in the US, including 512,000 principals and other administrators at elementary and secondary schools. This is a 4% increase from 2018 and a **23.5% increase from 2013**.

### The AASA Counterargument

The American Association of School Administrators (AASA) offers a different framing:
- The ratio of central-office staff to teachers was **32.4:1 in 1992-93** and **33:1 in 2002-03** — essentially unchanged
- Public schools have a staff-to-administrator ratio of roughly **13:1**, compared to **3.3:1 in public administration** generally, suggesting schools are *less* top-heavy than government overall
- AASA argues that when all central-office administrative and professional staff are included, there has been "no significant increase" in administrators relative to teachers

## 5. What Actually Drives Cost Increases: Claims vs. Data

### The "Administrative Bloat" Claim

The popular narrative: schools have hired armies of administrators while neglecting classrooms, and this is the primary driver of rising per-pupil costs.

**What the staffing data shows:** There has been genuine, dramatic growth in non-teaching staff — up 702% since 1950 vs. 96% for enrollment. District administrative staff specifically grew 74.9% from 2000-2017 vs. 7.7% for teachers. Non-teaching staff now outnumber teachers.

**What the spending data shows:** Administration spending (narrowly defined) has grown at roughly the same rate as instruction spending — about 18-20% in real per-pupil terms from 2002 to 2020. Administration remains a relatively small share of total spending:
- General administration (superintendent/board): ~2% of current expenditures (~$265/pupil in 2020)
- School administration (principals): ~5.6% of current expenditures (~$758/pupil in 2020)
- Combined: ~7-8% of current expenditures

### The FEE/Tabarrok Counterpoint

Alex Tabarrok (George Mason, via FEE) argues the bloat narrative is overstated:
- Principals and administrators number only **0.4 per 100 students** — a figure that barely changed from 1950 to 2015
- "A bloated little toe cannot explain a 20-pound weight gain"
- The real explanation: we hired more teachers (the student-teacher ratio halved from ~27:1 to ~15:1) and pay them more in real terms
- The administrator increase was largely complete by 1980, but expenditures kept growing

### The Real Cost Drivers (in order of magnitude)

**1. Employee Benefits — the largest single driver**
- Benefits spending: +81.1% per pupil (2002-2023), from $2,221 to $4,022/pupil
- Salary spending: +7.7% per pupil (same period)
- For every $1 added to salaries, $3.27 went to benefits
- Pension debt is a primary culprit: states failed to adequately fund pension obligations, and "catch-up" contributions now consume enormous sums
- NJ has the highest per-pupil benefits cost at $8,333/student (2023)
- Nationally, salaries fell from 59% to 55% of current expenditures (2010-2021), while benefits rose from 21% to 24%

**2. Pupil Support Services / Special Education Mandates**
- Pupil support services: +52.7% per pupil (2002-2020), from $566 to $864/pupil — the fastest-growing expenditure category by rate
- Special education averages **$13,127 per identified student** (FY 2020, 24-state sample)
- Federal IDEA funding covers only ~12% of what states/districts spend; the local gap averages $8,160/student
- The proportion of students receiving special education has trended upward
- Categories include psychologists, guidance counselors, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, social workers, health services — all mandated by law
- Connecticut: $24,443/pupil for special ed; Mississippi: $5,265/pupil

**3. Staffing Growth Beyond Enrollment**
- 15.1% more staff for 4.1% more students (2002-2023)
- Non-teaching roles: +22.8%; teaching roles: +7.6%
- The Edunomics Lab (Georgetown) found enrollment declined by ~750,000 since 2014 while employment grew by 600,000+ positions
- Had non-teaching staff grown at the same rate as students since 1992, schools would have an estimated additional **$24.3 billion annually** (Friedman Foundation)

**4. Class Size Reduction**
- The student-teacher ratio dropped from ~27:1 (1955) to ~15:1 (2023) — nearly halved
- This required roughly doubling the teaching workforce relative to enrollment
- Tabarrok identifies this as the primary historical cost driver, not administration

**5. Administration (narrowly defined) — significant but not dominant**
- General + school administration combined: ~7-8% of current expenditures
- Growth rate (18-20%) was roughly in line with instruction (20%)
- District administrative staff growth (74.9%, 2000-2017) is real but represents a small absolute base
- The 2025 DeAngelis & Makridis study (*Politics & Policy*) found administrative growth is more pronounced in states with stronger teachers' union influence

### The Nuanced Picture

The data suggests a synthesis:
1. **Non-teaching staff have genuinely proliferated** — the 702% growth since 1950 is not in dispute
2. **But most of those aren't "administrators" in the popular sense** — they're counselors, social workers, speech pathologists, instructional aides, health staff, and technology support
3. **Many of these roles are legally mandated** — IDEA, Section 504, state mental health requirements, and other mandates drive much of the "support services" growth
4. **The spending data does not show administration taking an ever-larger share** — instruction's share has held steady at 60-61%, and administration's share hasn't meaningfully grown
5. **The real cost story is benefits and mandated services** — pension/health costs up 81%, pupil support up 53%, while salaries are nearly flat
6. **Teacher pay has actually declined in real terms** (-6.1%, 2002-2022) even as total spending per pupil rose 36%

---

## 6. International Comparison (OECD)

- The US spends **$14,603 per student** at primary through upper-secondary levels (OECD measure), above the OECD average
- Part of the US spending "lead" comes from **ancillary services** (athletics, student housing) that other countries don't fund at comparable levels
- US students receive more instructional time: **974 hours/year** (primary) and **1,023 hours/year** (lower secondary) vs. OECD averages of 804 and 909 hours
- Despite high investment, US adult literacy scores are at the OECD average (28% at Level 1 or below), and mean literacy proficiency **decreased** across all age groups between 2012 and 2023
