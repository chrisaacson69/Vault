# YouTube Migration
> Turning vault research into YouTube scripts — putting ideas into the ether and letting them fall where they do.

**Status:** planning
**Created:** 2026-02-26
**Links:** [Vault Index](../../INDEX.md), [Words of Wisdom](../../notes/words-of-wisdom.md), [Online Debates](../../research/debates/README.md)

## Purpose

The vault contains interconnected frameworks built from first principles across economics, philosophy, morality, legal theory, civilizational cycles, and more. These ideas are "alien" to most people — not because they're wrong, but because the reasoning path is unfamiliar. The goal isn't to convince — it's to put the ideas out there, invite honest debate, and let them find whoever's ready to hear them. Maybe after the next cycle or two.

## The Pipeline: Vault → Script

### Step 1: Identify the Core Claim
Every video starts with a single provocative sentence. Not a topic — a *claim*.

- Bad: "Let's talk about insurance"
- Good: "Insurance companies cover what doesn't need covering and refuse to cover what does"
- Bad: "The morality of law"
- Good: "Morality, ethics, and law are the same thing with different enforcement mechanisms"

The vault topics already have these — they're the `>` summary lines at the top of each page.

### Step 2: Map the Argument
Pull the logical chain from the vault page. Most pages already have this structure:
1. Observation (the pattern everyone can see)
2. Framework (why the pattern exists — the "alien" part)
3. Implications (what follows if the framework is right)
4. Stress tests (where it might break — honest about limits)

### Step 3: Back with Authorities
The "loon on the internet" problem is real. The fix isn't credentials — it's references. For each major claim, find 2-3 recognized sources who support components:

- "Don't take my word for it — here's Douglass North's Nobel Prize work saying the same thing about institutions"
- "Kohlberg's stages of moral development map onto exactly this pattern"
- "Hayek distinguished between law and legislation for the same structural reason"

The vault already has theoretical grounding sections in several pages. These become the reference backbone. Expand as needed — each video should have its own reference list.

### Step 4: Concrete Examples
Three types, layered for credibility:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Personal** | Authenticity, lived experience | Cancer treatment self-insurance math; auto insurance rebellion |
| **Historical** | Pattern recognition across time | Kosher laws as ancestral food safety; East India Company as private government |
| **Cross-domain** | The "chords of the same theme" connector | Monopoly AI data demonstrating insurance theory; civilizational cycles in Demolition Man |

Personal examples are the hook. Historical examples are the credibility. Cross-domain examples are the brand — the thing nobody else is doing.

### Step 5: Script Structure
A working format (adjust per topic):

```
[HOOK] — The provocative claim. 30 seconds.
[OBSERVATION] — "Here's what everyone can see." 1-2 minutes.
[FRAMEWORK] — "Here's why it works this way." The core argument. 3-5 minutes.
[EVIDENCE] — Authorities + examples. 3-5 minutes.
[IMPLICATIONS] — "If this is right, then..." 2-3 minutes.
[HONEST LIMITS] — "Here's where this might break." 1-2 minutes.
[INVITATION] — "Tell me where I'm wrong." 30 seconds.
```

Target: 12-18 minutes per video. Long enough for substance, short enough for attention.

## The Ancestral Knowledge Thread

Example of a cross-cutting topic that ties vault themes together:

**Kosher laws as encoded empirical knowledge:** "Don't eat shellfish" wasn't divine command or arbitrary tradition — it was empirical observation ("people who eat these things in the desert get sick and die") encoded in religious law because that was the only enforcement mechanism available. The reasoning was lost; the rule survived as dogma.

This is:
- **Scope confusion** — empirical knowledge (morality-scope) promoted to religious law (law-scope) because religious authority was the available enforcement mechanism
- **Chesterton's Fence** — the rule looks arbitrary until you understand what it solved
- **Civilizational cycles** — knowledge accumulates, gets codified, the codification survives after the reasoning is forgotten
- **The modern parallel** — we follow FDA regulations we don't understand for the same structural reasons

This pattern (ancestral knowledge encoded in religion/tradition) is a standalone video AND a recurring thread across the series.

## Channel Strategy

**Open question:** One channel or multiple?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Single channel** | "Chords of the same theme" — the interconnection IS the brand. Cross-pollination between topics. | Harder to build audience — economics viewers may not care about philosophy |
| **Multiple channels** | Clean topic targeting. Algorithm-friendly. | Loses the synthesis. The vault's power is the connections. |
| **Single + playlists** | Best of both — one brand, organized by topic for discoverability | Requires enough volume to make playlists worthwhile |

Lean toward single channel with playlists. The connections are the differentiator. Anyone can talk about insurance or morality separately — the synthesis is what's new.

## Candidate Topics (from vault)

Roughly ordered by accessibility (easiest entry point first):

| # | Topic | Vault Source | Core Claim |
|---|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Insurance is a scam | [Insurance](../../research/economics/insurance.md) | Insurance covers what doesn't need covering and excludes what does |
| 2 | Opposing forces | [Opposing Forces](../../research/philosophy/opposing-forces.md) | Every concentration of power generates the force that destroys it |
| 3 | Scope confusion | [Scope Confusion](../../research/philosophy/morality/scope-confusion.md) | Most political disagreements are people applying the wrong enforcement mechanism |
| 4 | You get what you pay for | [Words of Wisdom](../../notes/words-of-wisdom.md) + [Insurance](../../research/economics/insurance.md) | Subsidizing X always produces more X — incentives don't care about intentions |
| 5 | Monopolies fix themselves | [Opposing Forces](../../research/philosophy/opposing-forces.md) + [Scope Confusion](../../research/philosophy/morality/scope-confusion.md) | Government intervention against monopolies produces captured regulation — worse than the original |
| 6 | Civilizational cycles | [Civilizational Cycles](../../research/philosophy/civilizational-cycles.md) | Every civilization follows the same arc for the same structural reasons |
| 7 | Ancestral knowledge | (new — Kosher laws thread) | Ancient "religious" rules are often empirical knowledge in disguise |
| 8 | The Kohlberg trap | [Civilizational Cycles](../../research/philosophy/civilizational-cycles.md) + [Scope Confusion](../../research/philosophy/morality/scope-confusion.md) | Demanding government fix everything is developmental regression |
| 9 | The weighting problem | [Weighting Problem](../../research/philosophy/epistemology/weighting-problem.md) | Objective measurements don't produce objective rankings |
| 10 | Compassion without information | [Insurance](../../research/economics/insurance.md) | Compassion without information is indistinguishable from recklessness |
| 11 | BattleValue | [BattleValue](../../research/gaming/battle-value.md) | One formula compares any two units in any game — and it's the same math militaries use |

More topics will emerge as the vault grows.

## Reference Library (to build)

Each video needs its reference list. Start collecting:
- **Economics:** Hayek, Mises, Knight, Sowell, Douglass North, Elinor Ostrom
- **Philosophy:** Kohlberg, Hart-Devlin, Ellickson, Lewis (Tao/Abolition of Man)
- **History:** Tainter, Turchin, Ibn Khaldun, Toynbee, Glubb
- **Personal:** Cancer treatment, auto insurance, the psychiatrist's color question

Build reference pages in the vault as needed — one per major source, with relevant quotes and page numbers for citation.
