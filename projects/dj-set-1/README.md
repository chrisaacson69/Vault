# DJ Set 1 — Progressive/Trance Mix
> 11-track set built around texture-over-harmony philosophy, with a BPM staircase from 120→129.

## Set Philosophy

- **Melody into beats, beats into new melody** — overlap rhythmic/percussive sections to bridge harmonic gaps
- **Texture over harmony** in the back half — tracks 7-11 "break Camelot" intentionally, using shared rhythm and energy rather than key compatibility
- **BPM staircase**: 120 → 123 → 126 → 126 → 126 → 129 → 129 → 129 → 129 → 129, with three clean steps up
- **32-bar overlaps** where possible; clean cuts where BPM gaps or style clashes make overlap risky

## Full Set Map

### Track 1: Martin Roth — Deep Style (Original Mix)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 120.19 |
| Full Duration | 480s (8:00) |
| Dominant Key | 12A (Db minor) |
| Key Timeline | 4A (0-7) → 11A (8-15) → 4A (16-31) → 5A (32-55) → **2A (56-63)** → **12A (64-131)** → 2A (132-163) → 12A (164-175) → 5A (176-191) → 11A (192-199) → 4A (200-223) → 2A (224-240) |

**Set entry:** Bar ~59 (the 2A bridge). The 12A groove kicks in at bar 64 — this is the opener's identity.
**Used bars:** ~59 to ~175 (116 bars)
**Used time:** ~232s (3:52) | Range: **3:20 – 4:40**

### Track 2: Marsh feat. Mimi Page — Foss
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 123.05 |
| Full Duration | 338s (5:38) |
| Dominant Key | 3A (Bb minor), 58% |
| Key Timeline | 6A (0-15) → 3A (16-55) → 2B (56-63) → 3A (64-103) → 11A (104-111) → 3A (112+) |
| Key Events | Bar 48: decrease | Bar 57: melodic drop | Bar 64: fill | Bar 68: increase | Bar 100: increase | Bar 128: **decrease (wind-down begins)** |

**Transition IN (from Deep Style):** Clean cut or very short overlap. 3 BPM gap (120→123). Foss opens quietly — needs to get going by the 6A section. Option: bump Deep Style up to 123 for last few bars, or clean cut and let Foss start fresh.
**Used bars:** ~0 to ~165 (full track)
**Used time:** ~322s (5:22) | Range: **5:00 – 5:38**

---

### Track 3: Alone (Extended Mix)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 123.05 |
| Full Duration | 432.5s (7:12) |
| Dominant Key | 6A (G minor), 64.7% |
| Key Timeline | **6A (0-35)** → 4A (36-47) → **9B (48-67)** → 6A (68-127) → 9B (128-151) → 6A (152-199) → 9B (200+, outro) |
| Key Events | Bar 16: increase | Bar 24: increase (perc+, melodic+) | **Bar 56: bassline drop (THE attention grabber)** | Bar 128: decrease | Bar 200: final drop |

**Transition IN (from Foss):** Energy crossfade through Alone's 6A opening. Cue Alone at Foss bar ~128 (energy drops). Foss (3A) overlaps Alone (6A) — 5/7 shared notes, smooth. Foss fades naturally over ~35 bars as Alone builds. By Alone bar 36, Foss is gone. 4A bridge (bars 36-47) leads into 9B. Bassline drops at bar 56. Dead air reduced to ~20 bars of building tension.

| Foss Bar | Alone Bar | What Happens |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 128 | 0 | Foss energy drops, Alone enters in 6A |
| 144 | 16 | Alone increase (energy+, bass+), Foss fading |
| 152 | 24 | Alone increase (perc+, melodic+), Foss very thin |
| ~163 | ~35 | Foss gone. Alone's 6A wraps |
| — | 36 | 4A bridge (solo Alone) |
| — | 48 | 9B arrives |
| — | 56 | **Bassline.** |

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~220 (full track)
**Used time:** ~432s (7:12) | Range: **6:50 – 7:15**
**Overlap with Foss:** ~35 bars ≈ 68s

### Track 4: Kasablanca — Am I Dreaming? *(swapped from position 5)*
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 126.05 |
| Full Duration | 212.65s (3:33) |
| Dominant Key | 7A (D minor), 37.6% |
| Key Timeline | 4A (0-23) → **7A (24-43)** → 10B (44-71) → 4A (72-79) → 7A (80+) |
| Key Events | Bar 8: increase | Bar 20: increase (perc+, melodic+) | Bar 44: decrease | Bar 60: increase | Bar 72: increase (perc+, energy+) | Bar 80: increase |

**Transition IN (from Alone):** Clean cut. Alone rides its 9B outro (bar 200+, energy fading to silence). Am I Dreaming enters quiet with the "Am I dreaming?" vocal hit at ~13 seconds (~bar 7). BPM jumps 123→126 — no overlap means no BPM conflict. The vocal resets the room's attention.

**Why swapped:** Original order (Otoño here) created a 7A→2A transition later (2/7 shared notes — painful). Swapping puts Am I Dreaming's 7A after Alone's 6A (adjacent on Camelot wheel, 6/7 notes) and moves Otoño's 4B before Lady Danger's 2A (5/7 notes). Eliminates worst harmonic clash in the set.

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~112 (full track — it's short)
**Used time:** ~213s (3:33) | Range: **3:20 – 3:35**

---

### Track 5: Orbital — Otoño *(swapped from position 4)*
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 126.05 |
| Full Duration | 348.51s (5:49) |
| Dominant Key | 4B (Ab major), 75.1% |
| Key Timeline | 4B (0-16) → 5B (17-24) → 4B (25-40) → 1A (41-48) → 4B (49-96) → 1A (97-112) → **4B (113-152)** → 1A (153-160) → 4B (161+) |
| Key Events | Bar 3: melodic drop/recovery | Bar 9: **increase (track really starts here)** | Bar 13: perc drop | Bar 17: increase | Bar 25: increase (energy+, bass+) | Bar 113: decrease | Bar 118: fill | Bar 121: increase |

**Transition IN (from Am I Dreaming):** Clean cut at Otoño bar 9 (where the track actually starts). First 8 bars are stylistically odd and don't blend. Both at 126 BPM — no conflict. 7A→4B = 4/7 shared notes, but with a clean cut there's no overlap to clash.

**Used bars:** ~9 to ~183 (skipping odd intro)
**Used time:** ~331s (5:31) | Range: **5:15 – 5:49**

---

### Track 6: Lady Danger (Mixed)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 126.05 |
| Full Duration | 384.55s (6:25) |
| Dominant Key | 2A (Eb minor), 62.7% |
| Key Timeline | 2A (0-39) → 3A (40-51) → 6B (52-59) → **2A (60-95)** → 4B (96-103) → 3A (104-135) → **2A (136-187)** → 4A (188+) |
| Key Events | Bar 40: decrease | Bar 48: decrease | Bar 64: increase | Bar 96: decrease | Bar 105: fill | Bar 108: fill | Bar 128: increase | Bar 136: increase | Bar 176: increase | Bar 196: decrease |

**Transition IN (from Otoño):** Overlap or clean cut. 4B→2A = 5/7 shared notes — comfortable. Lady Danger has 40 bars of intro before first structural event, plenty of runway. Both at 126 BPM.

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~202 (full track)
**Used time:** ~385s (6:25) | Range: **6:00 – 6:30**
**Overlap with Otoño:** 0–20 bars ≈ 0–38s

### Track 7: You Are Sleeping (PQM Meets Luke Chable Vocal Pass)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 129.2 |
| Full Duration | 576.4s (9:36) |
| Dominant Key | 1A (Ab minor), 69.6% |
| Key Timeline | 8A (0-64, percussive intro) → **1A (65-280)** → 11A (281-288) → 8A (289+) |
| Key Events | Bar 65: decrease (perc-) marks 1A entry | Bar 104: perc drop | Bar 137: increase | Bar 169: decrease | Bar 177: increase | Bar 208: perc drop | Bar 241: decrease | Bar 257: increase | **Bar 264: perc drop (outro zone)** | **Bar 273: perc drop (should be transitioning)** | **Bar 289: fill (must be out)** |

**Transition IN (from Lady Danger):** Lady Danger fades, You Are Sleeping enters on percussive 8A intro (bars 0-64). Key clash (2A vs 8A = ~1/7 notes) doesn't matter — it's all beats and percussion. BPM gap 126→129: clean handoff avoids overlap. By bar 65 when the melodic 1A drops, Lady Danger is long gone.

**Set entry:** Bar 65 (1A section begins)
**Set exit:** By bar 289 (must be fully out)
**Used bars:** 65 to 289 = 224 bars
**Used time:** ~416s (6:56) | Range: **6:30 – 7:15**

---

### Track 8: Quivver — Brothers & Sisters (Original Mix)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 129.2 |
| Full Duration | 485.87s (8:06) |
| Dominant Key | 1A (Ab minor), 72% |
| Key Timeline | **1A (0-111)** → 5B (112-127) → 2A (128-135) → **1A (136-191)** → 2A (192-199) → 5B (200-235) → 1A (236-256) |

**Transition IN (from You Are Sleeping):** 1A→1A at the mix point — perfect harmonic match. ~25 bar overlap with 89 bars of runway. Both at 129 BPM.

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~256 (full track)
**Used time:** ~486s (8:06) | Range: **7:30 – 8:10**
**Overlap with You Are Sleeping:** ~25 bars ≈ 46s

---

### Track 9: Below The Belt (Chris Micali Remix)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 129.2 |
| Full Duration | 488.92s (8:09) |
| Dominant Key | 4A (F minor), 46.9% |
| Key Timeline | **1A (1-16, intro)** → 4A (17-28) → 8A (29-48) → 4A (49-64) → 8A (65-96) → **4A (97-192)** → **1A (193-256, outro)** |

**Transition IN (from Quivver):** 1A→1A at the edges. Below The Belt intro is percussive — big kick drum, playful bass, rhythmic deep vocals ("da, da, da, da"). ~32 bar safe overlap zone.
**Transition OUT:** Outro returns to 1A at bar 193 — the 1A thread continues!

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~256 (full track)
**Used time:** ~489s (8:09) | Range: **7:30 – 8:15**
**Overlap with Quivver:** ~32 bars ≈ 59s

### Track 10: Ronski Speed & Syntrobic feat. Renee Stahl — Pink Skye
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 129.2 |
| Full Duration | 344.86s (5:45) |
| Dominant Key | 9A (E minor), 66.6% |
| Key Timeline | **9A (1-48)** → 9B (49-104) → **9A (105-180)** → 6A (181-185) |

**Transition IN (from Below The Belt):** HARD transition — 1A vs 9A, harmonically distant. Energy dips at Ronski bars 13, 29 provide landing points. Strategy: EQ — cut Below The Belt's mids/highs, let Ronski's percussion slide in underneath. Lean into the tension or keep the overlap short and percussive.

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~185 (full track)
**Used time:** ~345s (5:45) | Range: **5:15 – 5:50**
**Overlap with Below The Belt:** ~16 bars ≈ 30s (keep it short)

### Track 11: LTN — Daylight (Original Mix) [Closer]
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| BPM | 129.2 |
| Full Duration | 389.97s (6:30) |
| Dominant Key | 8B (C major), 41.8% |
| Key Timeline | 5A (0-11) → **8B (12-63)** → 5A (64-115) → 4A (116-151) → 5A (152-159) → **8B (160-195)** → 11A (196-207) |

**Transition IN (from Ronski Speed):** 9A→8B share 6/7 notes — comfortable overlap. ~19 bars of safe overlap. Ronski's rhythm at bars 157-169 matches LTN around bar 19, vocals kick in by bar 21. 8B arrives at bar 12, giving a short but workable runway.

**Closing strategy:** LTN is the closer. Three options:
1. **Let it breathe** — ride 8B out past bar 63, let the 5A section at bar 64 serve as the cooldown
2. **End on emotion** — the 8B return at bar 160 is the last big moment, fade after that
3. **End on breakdown** — 5A section (bars 64-115) brings energy down naturally, could end mid-track if the vibe is right

The outro winds down nicely and brings people back toward the 120 BPM opener's energy.

**Used bars:** ~0 to ~207 (full track plays out)
**Used time:** ~390s (6:30) | Range: **5:30 – 6:30**
**Overlap with Ronski Speed:** ~19 bars ≈ 35s

## Future Work

- [ ] Ear-test the full set with actual overlaps
- [x] Explore set mastering tools (potentially AI-aware) that accept analysis data → [Set Mastering Pipeline](../set-mastering/README.md)
- [x] Research programmatic mixing tools → [Programmatic DJ Mixing Tools](../../research/programmatic-dj-mixing-tools.md)
- [x] Rekordbox export from camelot tool (library management, cue points)
- [ ] Export to set mastering tools (key timelines, energy profiles, structural events) → see [Set Mastering Pipeline](../set-mastering/README.md)
- [x] UI fix: losing positioning when clicking across charts and zoom levels in audio_ui
- [ ] Refine exact cue points and overlap lengths after ear testing
