## Overview

Progressive learning path through official PyTorch "Learn the Basics" tutorials. Eight scripts covering tensors, datasets, transforms, neural network construction, autograd, optimization loops, and model save/load. Uses FashionMNIST as the running example.

### Lessons

1. Quickstart — end-to-end training pipeline
2. Tensors — creation, operations, GPU transfer
3. Datasets & DataLoaders — loading and batching
4. Transforms — preprocessing pipelines
5. Neural Networks — `nn.Module`, layers, forward pass
6. Autograd — automatic differentiation
7. Optimization — training loop, loss, SGD
8. Save/Load — model persistence and checkpoints
