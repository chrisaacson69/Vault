## Completed

### GitHub Migration ✓
Moved all `source/repos/` projects to GitHub under `chrisaacson69`. Vault is its own repo; code projects are separate repos. Vault project pages use `**Repo:**` fields pointing to GitHub URLs.

**Repos pushed:**
- [Vault](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/Vault) — personal knowledge system
- [camelot_from_youtube](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/camelot_from_youtube) — DJ track analysis toolkit
- [batch-resize](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/batch-resize) — image batch resizer
- [order-playlist](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/order-playlist) — DJ playlist optimizer
- [monopoly](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/monopoly) — Monopoly AI (reorganized: ai/, player/, research/, integration/, source-material/)
- [slay](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/slay) — hex strategy game (Python)
- [slay-c](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/slay-c) — hex strategy game (C port)
- [triangular-arbitrage](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/triangular-arbitrage) — currency/crypto arbitrage
- [pytorch-learning](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/pytorch-learning) — PyTorch tutorial series
- [pytorch-audio-learning](https://github.com/chrisaacson69/pytorch-audio-learning) — TorchAudio tutorial series

## In Progress

### Is-Ought Bridge / Grounding Morality
The central open question: does "you exist and must act" ground morality empirically, or does Agrippa's trilemma always produce infinite regress? Connected to the weighting problem's "conditional-ought escape" and the debate analyses. Resolving this shapes everything downstream (scope confusion, civilizational cycles, legal theory).

- [Weighting Problem](../research/philosophy/epistemology/weighting-problem.md)
- [Agrippa Debate](../research/debates/agrippa-axioms-wilson-whatever.md)
- [Moral Foundations Debate](../research/debates/moral-foundations-wilson-whatever.md)

## Up Next

### Epistemology — develop from stub
The vault's epistemological foundation (structural realism, convergence-as-evidence) hasn't been examined on its own terms. Everything depends on this.
- [Epistemology](../research/philosophy/epistemology/README.md)

### Define "flourishing" (even provisionally)
The morality framework's dependent variable. Needed to complete the is-ought bridge.

### Coercion boundary analysis
Where does "limiting choices" (aggression) end and "merely not providing choices" begin? A NAP question from the measurement-causality and government-formation work.
- [Measurement, Causality](../research/philosophy/measurement-causality.md) (line ~92)
- [Government Formation](../research/philosophy/legal-theory/government-formation.md) (line ~265)

### Cognitive vs. Motor Skills — develop from stub
Referenced by cyborg model, measurement-causality, and LLM grounding problem. Needs architecture comparison, latency argument, embodied cognition.
- [Cognitive vs. Motor](../research/cognitive-vs-motor.md)

### Scope legitimacy criteria
Rules for when zoom-in vs. zoom-out is legitimate in the morality framework's scope model. Without this, scope-shifting is a tool for justification.

## Someday / Maybe

- Fraud as aggression (without mens rea) + serial fraud problem
- Marriage / shared ownership under natural law
